B00HDGJY8S,9,"",B00HDGJY8S,5.0,"purchased for my grandsons to use when visiting..... it is large.... large enough for an an adult to get into.  The material is a cotton canvas... not terribly thick, but not too thin in my opinion.  It was relatively easy to put together... I like that this is a bottom floor attached.  It is quite popular to stay grandma's and camp out.... I added some &#34;nap pads&#34; which are perfect for the 5 and 2 year old.  I also added a stuffed bear and alligator and a camp lantern that is a lantern or a star map night light.  Honestly, I keep it up in the corner of my living room so it is ready for any visit. It does come with a handy bag that has a handle if you'd like to store it when not in use.  The poles are wood... a pine I believe... very sturdy.  I would recommend this teepee...  I always update if there are any issues that may be helpful.<br />3/25/2016 UPDATE:  ...so I just finished deconstructing the teepee and felt an undate with tips might be helpful... first... you will never get the canvas teepee back into the canvas bag provided... it's like folding/rolling a really thick fitted sheet and trying to get into a tube sock.... BUT the wooden poles fit nicely into the canvas bag along with the plastic connector pieces... it would have been nice if the connectors gripped the poles better and stayed connected during the deconstruct phase... however... I just removed all the holed top pieces and then turned the teepee upside down and shook it sort of like a pillow case... the lower pieces eventually come out...  I just rolled the teepee up, put all the poles and connector pieces in the bag and set in a large drawer I have.  I would have lowered my rating one star for the deconstruct hassle, but honestly, my grandsons love it so much I just can't. The quality is such that this is going to last for many years if we take care of it.  It's just a matter of learning how to use it in an efficient manner.  Also... I have hard wood floors, so I went to a local carpet store and purchased some carpet padding.  I cut into a circle and place it under the teepee when I have it set up... I worry less about bonked heads that way - grandsons 5 years and 2 years.  Ok!  Hope this is indeed helpful info!",,Very sturdy and worth it,AFZUK3MTBIBEDQOPAK3OATUOUKLA,true

True, this Elenco version isn't very sturdy.  It's light and flimsy.  But the overall layout, components, and experiments you can wire together are about the same.  The 159-page real paper manual that comes with it is a plus (the PDF is also available for download from Elenco's web site).  Each experiment has an overview, a schematic, and wiring connection-by-numbers instructions.  Many useful and educational analog circuit designs are included (plus one digital gate logic IC).  No microprocessor, computer, smart phone, or software updates required.  Yea!!!<br /><br />OK, now the quality issues.  The first experiments I correctly wired together didn't work at all.  I installed two different sets of 6AA batteries (Amazon Rechargeable then Duracell Alkaline).  Still nothing.  I returned the first one back to Amazon, got a replacement the next day.  Both had the same problem.  Both had a sticker with Date Code 0119.  Hmmmm, manufactured the same day, same problem.  I did some basic troubleshooting to try to figure out the problem.<br /><br />It turns out the design or manufacture of the battery holder is defective.  There is a gap of about 1mm between the + side of each battery and terminals in the holder.  Two small plastic tabs at that location prevented the battery connection from being made.  My \"fix\" was to jam a wadded up piece of copper tape to fill the gap at each of the 6 positive battery terminals to complete the battery circuit (aluminum foil would work fine too). Hopefully Elenco will crack the whip at the Chinese factory to fix this, or they'll see a lot of returns for this very simple and silly defect.  Check recent reviews to see if the problem has been fixed in newer batches from the factory.<br /><br />If you don't have a voltmeter, you can construct a simple circuit to see if power from the batteries is making it to the front panel.  Install the batteries and try lighting up the decimal point of the digital display by connecting: 25-121,24-119 or 25-124,24-122<br /><br />Most of the experiments I've tried so far worked.  But the AM radio receiver circuits are iffy.  The only one I could make work was #113: Two-Transistor Radio.  I used the supplied long green wire raised up high as the antenna.  The signal levels seem too low to work for #112:  Crystal Set Radio and #109:  Operational Amplifier AM Radio.<br /><br />Quality issues aside, I'm keeping it.  I'm having too much fun with it.  And I have great respect for the designers who created the original analog circuits that can be recreated using this kit.",,Check the positive battery holder terminals,AEDHXXX2F66EMWOSSPCQHS62UKNQ,true

It's a three-part puzzle.  First you assemble a standard jigsaw (an 1867 Chicago street map).  Next you assemble a foam-based jigsaw with identical interlocking tabs (a modern Chicago street map) that goes atop the first jigsaw.  Third you add three-dimensional plastic buildings to the foam jigsaw.<br /><br />The first jigsaw is difficult, especially in the large blue Lake Michigan area, but the street names and the boats on the lake help enough to make this an expert-but-fairly-easy jigsaw.  The second foam jigsaw comes partly assembled, with several large pieces, and is very easy, taking less than an hour. (Unless you separate all the smallest foam street-grid pieces, which will require a lot of close comparison with the color map, and a lot of extra unsatisfying puzzle time, to reassemble.)<br /><br />The third part, adding the buildings, is where the whole puzzle concept breaks down.  Unless you're familiar with Chicago already, the buildings are hard to identify by comparing the plastic pieces with the photographs on the color buildings poster.  You have to identify each building by finding its numbered location on the color map, and then matching the appearance of the roof to the line drawing of the roof found in the punch-out foam puzzle piece at the location in the foam map. (With some similar buildings, this is quite difficult, and you have to check the size of the plastic bases as well.  It also helps to know how to read architectural diagrams.)<br /><br />Finally, inserting the buildings is a major problem.  If you punch out the foam piece where the building goes in, you will NOT be able to tell how the building is oriented to the street and the buildings around it.  If you don't punch out the foam piece, but merely jam the building down onto it, the building will fall over whenever you jostle the foam as you add more buildings.  Another problem is that some historic buildings are gold and the rest are silver-gray.<br /><br />The puzzle kit also includes a set of silver-gray &quot;generic&quot; buildings that you can add to make the Chicago downtown look more like a skyscraper city.  However, you don't know when these buildings were built, so inserting them destroys the historical timeline that helps you see how Chicago grew.<br /><br />I was really excited about this puzzle, because I wanted to see all the buildings added after I departed Chicago in the sixties.  However, adding the buildings was fiddly and far too much of a hassle, so I bailed on the project after 25 buildings.  (If I ever decide to go back and finish it, I will glue the buildings in place atop the foam.)<br /><br />In sum, although the standard jigsaw is fun to assemble, it is overpriced at the cost of the entire kit (about $30 on Amazon).  The rest of the kit was a big disappointment. Now I think I'll try to find a book of photographs that will show me how Chicago has grown since 1867, or since the sixties.",,"Hard-to-Identify, Hard-to-Set-Up Buildings Destroy Fun of Assembling Kit",AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q,true
B011VSK1WQ,3,"",B011VSK1WQ,2.0,"This  PEGBOARD SET WITH PATTERN CARD comes with lots of big, colorful, stackable pegs, but the foam base is something of a disaster.  Out of the box, the holes are too small for the pegs, so the instructions say to &#34;condition&#34; the base by inserting the pegs all the way through the holes and leaving them there overnight.  This does enlarge the holes in the foam base, but the holes still want to close up.  This makes the pegs difficult to insert into the base for play.<br /><br />I purchased this set for my husband to use for occupational therapy at home, in conjunction with a Saebo glove,  to help restore functionality to his stroke-damaged hand.  Unfortunately, the set is useless for this purpose, because of the effort it takes to insert the pegs (even if you have full use of both hands).  I think it would be equally difficult for a child to use this set, at least until the foam base becomes well-worn so that the peg holes will stop closing up.<br /><br />A couple of pegboard sets that do work for my husband's hand therapy are the [[ASIN:B0009K30YY Learning Resources Stacking Shapes Peg Board]], and the [[ASIN:B008E18S60 Hape Color and Shape Sorter]].  Because of its disappointing foam base, I rate the Pegboard Set With Pattern Card at 2 stars (&#34;I don't like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",,"Holes in Foam Base Close Up, Making Peg Insertion Difficult",AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q,true
B006OZJWY0,31,"",B006OZJWY0,5.0,"This NEUSCHWANSTEIN CASTLE XXL puzzle is not for beginners, or for the faint of heart!  Any 2000-piece Ravensburger puzzle is difficult, simply because of the number of pieces, but this puzzle is probably above average in difficulty.<br /><br />The puzzle measures 52\" wide by 24\" high--it's a panoramic puzzle--so make sure you have cleared a wide space for it.  The XXL size means that the fine photo details are spread over more than one puzzle piece, and this increases the difficulty.  The puzzle is easiest to assemble if you stand over it as you go, so that you can see the bigger, overall picture.<br /><br />Ravensburger puzzles always have color areas to help you.  That's true of this puzzle, but the sky--there's lots of it!-- has less color variation than usual.  The border pieces are easy to find and assemble, but when you start on the remaining puzzle, it really dawns on you what a challenging task you have undertaken.  There are piles of dark blue, light blue, autumn-colored, and mostly-white pieces that look very much alike. For me, the hardest area was the lower left side, with all of the blue trees; and the big snow-covered tree at the right was far more difficult than I expected.  The castle was easy, and the autumn-colored trees were easier than you would think from looking at the box photo.<br /><br />Despite its difficulty, this puzzle was a pleasure to work.  The photo is just so beautiful!  Working at a comfortable pace (one to several hours at a stretch, but not every day), I needed about a month to finish this one.  As usual, I found the Ravensburger craftsmanship to be extraordinary--the pieces fit together so nicely that mistakes were few and far between.  I highly recommend this puzzle for expert (addicted) jigsaw puzzle enthusiasts.",,Not for Beginners or the Faint of Heart!,AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q,true

The logos, and numbers are all printed or applied well and look sharp and legible on the end product. The lid fits perfectly! The only issue we have discovered in our month of nightly use, is that all US coins (pennies, dimes and quarters) fit into and stand upright in the slots.. all except for nickles. They are simple too thick to fit. We learned this after our 3 yr old granddaughter tried to force a nickle into the #4 slot, gouging the surrounding wood in the process. This is not a big deal as my husband was able to re-router the slots to be ever so slightly wider so now all coins will fit into all slots with ease. Overall, this is a great game. Easy for all ages to play. Heck, it's a great game to have the littles play with you as they'll learn their numbers so they can place their coins. My husband and I keep this on our main table and play it at least once per evening. It's such a simply game that you can play it while having a conversation. It really takes no thought at all. We took it camping and played it when we were forced inside during a storm. Thinking of getting one to keep in the camper so we never forget it!

Usually even the things I buy that have crappy, nominal, barely-English instructions are pretty easy to figure out. There are modes and levels and timers yet only 3 buttons with no clearly defined labels (on the unit or in the instructions) on how to use. So to YouTube I went and had to watch a super annoying guy with a weird full-face mask and weirder 'just had my eyes dilated' sunglasses ramble his way through badly giving enough info on how to use that I could demonstrate the toy to my kid.<br /><br />That said, the little arms are progressively harder to knock back and register points on... which I get why... but even with my kid's  \"SHEESHAFREAKINGMIGHTY THAT HURTS LIKE A MUTHA...\" strong shooter, at close range, it is difficult to knock back the 50 and 75 point arms.

B00462PTZE,15,"",B09VTZ7VNG,4.0,"Melissa and Doug Princess Wooden Stamp Set is a fun toy that encourages creativity and keeps kids occupied. This stamp kit comes complete with nine different stamps, a small ink pad with pink and purple ink, and five colored pencils for your child's creative enjoyment.<br /><br />Melissa and Doug toys are known for education, creativity, and durability and most every product the company makes can be counted on to posses at least two of these qualities. The same is true with this toy. The Melissa and Doug Princess Wooden Stamp Set isn't big on educational quality, but it does encourage creativity and the set and storage container are made from wood, for better durability. The wooden container offers easy storage so that pieces do not get lost and the product's individual pieces are designed to last.<br /><br />Melissa and Doug Princess Wooden Stamp Set is simple yet fun and requires little supervision or explaining. My little princesses like this toy and still find it fun, but I have noticed that it lacks the staying power of some of their favorite toys. Unless I suggest it, they are not likely to use it. They do like it, but I think they have become a little bored with it. They prefer toys with movement and sound, and this offers neither.<br /><br />This stamp set is certainly durable, but one thing that isn't made to last is the ink pad. I like that the Melissa and Doug Princess Wooden Stamp Set comes complete with its own ink and my girls strongly appreciate that the ink is colored purple and pink. However, don't expect the ink to last very long. The small blotches of ink will not offer many stamping adventures, so be prepared to purchase additional ink stamps within a few months.<br /><br />Although not the perfect toy, the Melissa and Doug Princess Wooden Stamp Set is nonetheless a good toy for little princesses everywhere. It has many positive qualities, encourages creativity, and is priced right. Like I said, it lacks staying power, but it has enough positive qualities to recommend.",,Princess Stamp Set Encourages Creative Fun,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,true
B0038OMQ3E,10,"",B0038OMQ3E,3.0,"Olivia Dream It, Be It Role Play Set is a simple yet fairly fun dress- up collection aimed at fans of the television program Olivia. This set includes several items and accessories, like a tutu, slippers, crown, telescope, and other items that encourage kids to change into a different role and let their imagination run free.<br /><br />The Olivia Dream It, Be It Role Play Set has two sets of accessories: One for princess dress- up and one for an adventurer. My girls like both of the options, but they tend toward the princess set of accessories. The tutu, slippers, and crown are their favorites, but they like the other items as well. Having two sets in a single package is good for those with two kids because it means that both can have fun without fighting over who gets to enjoy the dress up set. There are items for two, so both are satisfied.<br /><br />This dress- up role play set can be fun and most girls will like it, but I do have a few issues with this dress up set and the main one is that there are simply not many items included. The trunk is small, and it surprised me when I saw it for the first time. Upon opening the trunk, I noticed that the small size made sense, given the small size of the included items. There are no actual clothing sets with this role play kit. The tutu is the closest item to an actual piece of clothing, but it is still very limited. The lack of complete outfits will frustrate some children and parents alike who purchase this expecting something more.<br /><br />My girls enjoy the Olivia television program and they like to play dress up, but they are only lukewarm about the Olivia Dream It, Be It Role Play Set. The items are quite small and there are only a few of them, so don't buy this expecting something incredible. Add a few more clothing items and the set would be much better, but considering its low price, it isn't too bad and it has just enough good qualities to award it with a small recommendation.",,Olivia Dress Up Kit is not What I Expected,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,true
B000GGBQGK,2,"",B000GGBQGK,3.0,"Woodstock Percussion Kid's Fantasy Guitar is a small, six- string guitar designed to entertain youngsters as they exercise their creative abilities. It is a good starting guitar for youngsters and it includes a few extras, such as a pick, additional string, and instruction booklet.<br /><br />This children's guitar is manufactured for young musicians in the making. It is small in size and easily fits in the hands of children. It is also very light weight so that children can easily hold it in place and play it without strain. It provides a means to make a little noise and create songs, making it a good choice as a creative outlet.<br /><br />Like I said, this guitar is very light weight in construction. It is so light, in fact, that I immediately began to question the guitar's durability. The construction is comprised of very thin pieces of wood and other materials and while nothing has happened since I purchased this guitar a few months ago, it seems like only a matter of time until something breaks.<br /><br />As for making music, this product does have some good things to offer. It creates a pleasant sound and kids will enjoy strumming the strings as they make up songs. Another nice factor is that the sound isn't very loud. One potential problem for some parents is that the strings cannot be tuned to the proper pitch. This instrument has the standard six strings, frets, and tuning knobs, etc., just like those of a standard guitar, but the strings can only be made to approximate the proper pitch. This won't matter to the vast majority of parents and I would say it is safe to assume that kids will not care either. But serious parental musicians may not like this.<br /><br />Of all the features of this guitar, the one that annoys me the most is the tendency of the strings to loosen. With ordinary usage, the strings slowly loosen up, regardless of whether or not the knobs have been touched. At first, I thought my girls were playing around with the knobs, but quick observation proved this was not the case. The strings just naturally loosen up, with regular usage.<br /><br />So, how does this children's guitar measure up overall? Well, it seems sufficient for its intended use and children will find it entertaining. On the other hand, its construction isn't very solid and the strings gradually loosen, even after a few minutes of use. Thus, considering all pros and cons, I'm going to give it an average rating overall. It hasn't broken or failed us yet, but it seems like a matter of time before it self- destructs and the field of pros and cons are basically equal.",,Woodtsock Fantasy Guitar: No Casualties.....Yet,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,true

I was disappointed because I thought these were magnetic not velcro and maybe I should of read the reviews before I bought the set.  The velcro worked however, like other reviewers the pieces didn't fit together as good as I would of liked.  They are great for cutting but for pretend playing and pretending its a whole piece of fruit would be rather difficult for it to stay together.  I think the toy was great, she loved it which is what mattered but for the price, I guess I expected a little more.",,Disappointed but still a good toy,AGV5XLEMIEYQBKNM33RTOUZMJEHQ,true

I was very hesitant in purchasing this since this wasn't exactly the same one he wanted but I am glad I didn't as my husband loves this one.  He mentioned that he was glad I got him this one because it's so fast that if he got the other one that's faster, he would of had an extremely hard time maneuvering.  He said this one was fast enough for him to learn on how to handle.  Additionally, this has been a very durable RC and he uses it in our Culdesac, street and even our yard.  He loves it!

This one proved to be surprisingly strategic.  You end up having to carefully consider how to use the roll because you can end up limiting your future opportunities with a bad choice, and the randomness of the dice definitely makes it difficult to completely mitigate luck.<br /><br />Of course, it is a dice based system so luck does play a role.

Each player is a nearby rancher who decides that they want to \"own\" the town and be able to take advantage of the huge influx of goods and gold that the railroad might bring.<br /><br />IN the game you do this by taking control over locatoins in town.  At first the town is rather small with only a few buildings, but each turn will add additional buildings.  Control of a building gives a player special powers that can be used as long as they keep one of their gunhands in the building to protect it.<br /><br />The play itself is rather simple.  Each turn has set steps and the scoring and winning conditions are easy to remmeber.<br /><br />However, Deadwood is best as a game for 4 people.  With 3 the game often becomes a beatdown of one player by the other two.<br /><br />This is a fun game, but hardly rises up to the level of hte better euro-game and strategy games out there.

B09RWFNXRC,0,"",B09X7C2GCB,5.0,"These 9 pocket pages work perfectly fine for baseball cards.  They are 6 mm thick, which is the same thickness as Card Guard or Ultra Pro SILVER Series pages (not Ultra Pro Platinum).  The seems welds are strong and do not tear apart like some other reviews have said.  The individual pockets are slightly oversized, which is actually kind of nice because your sports cards slide right into the pockets.<br /><br />However, these are not comparable to Ultra Pro Platinum.  Of course they aren't.  If you buy a box of 400 of these, that works out to be $0.09 per page.  Ultra Pro Platinum pages are between $0.20 and $0.22.  so these pages are half the price.  You should not expect them to be the same durability as UP Platinum.<br /><br />But overall, these pages provide great protection for cards and at $0.09 per page are a great value.  If you store sports cards in binders and 9 pocket pages, these are the highest quality at the lowest price you will find.  I would recommend you at least give them a try.

My teenage years were filled with watching Steven Spielberg creations like Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Goonies, Indiana Jones, Grelims, Poltergeist and so many more.

What wasn’t there to love? There was a cute (short, wrinkled) being from out of space accidentally left by his comrades; a clandestine/government agency intent on capturing him; three young kids (including the adorable Drew Barrymore) determined to return him home; the alien’s the attempt to make a phone (to phone home); a clueless mother (Dee Wallace) and the introduction of Reese’s Pieces (chocolate covered peanut butter circles-they melt in your mouth, not in your hands)!! What isn’t there to love. I miss those simpler times. The year 1982 was so much simpler.   <br /><br />My son started collecting Funko Pops circa 2019. I gave him his first one, from another one of my favorite movies - Diva Plavalaguna from 5th Element (I didn’t know any better and took out of the box and discarded it!). His collection is at over 200 and glowing. I try to get him some that are unique - flowed, glow in the dark, chase, scented and metallic. The figurine is the iconic scene of ET & Elliot riding on a bicycle in front of the moon. I love that the moon glows in the dark.

You never really rely on others players, it's just that some players can help each other out when possible, but no one loses before anyone else. You all lose at once.<br /><br />There aren't any story events from the books during each year. As you progress through years, your character cards swap out for older portraits and new enemies and spells are introduced, but your starting character spells never change. You always have to rebuild the deck and gain low level spells even in later years, which seems pretty silly. The strategy can be dumbed down after a while and it really just depends on who the starting villains you get dealt are. You could spend as long as you want building your deck if you get someone like Crabbe and Goyle in the first round.<br /><br />Dont expect this to be story-rich or something. Seems to just be harry potter themed, in the sense that this could really be almost any other story or universe that has multiple books or a serialized progression and it would also have worked fine.

We play best 2/3, and it usually takes about an hour.  Or: about 20 minutes per game.<br /><br />2.  It's variable.  What flops on the first turn can change the whole game, because each player has to react to it.  Each player is, of course, also reacting to the other player.  This translates into a number of different strategies, so each time you play it, it ends up being 'new' in some way, even if you're playing with the same person.  This variability makes it more fun because you can never just 'phone it in'.<br /><br />3.  It's easy to learn.  There aren't too many rules, so you can teach it to a new player in a few minutes.  Of course, they usually have to play several games before they start winning, but that's just a matter of learning the different strategies involved.<br /><br />Conclusion: HIGHLY recommended.",,Lots of Fun and Quick to Play,AF4DRCQLXSB5V72FH2SQTRW5YQRQ,true

B00009ZKRO,7,"",B09NPJGN9N,4.0,"Ok, I have to pull a star for excluding Pluto, but it's obvious the puzzle's educational value is not in learning about the solar system as much as it is in learning to complete jigsaw puzzles.  As such, the image has artistic and inspirational value, and not much educational value.  I mean, besides missing Pluto, the planets are not drawn to relative scale, the orbit and scale of their moons are way off, the colors are excessively saturated and so on -- but this isn't about teaching the solar system.  It's just a puzzle.  As such, it's a very good one.  The pieces are rigid, fit precisely for their size, appear to be durable, don't seem to easily warp, and those colors and object scales are off for a purpose -- to aide in one method of finding puzzle pieces that go together.  My 4 year old independently noticed that the Moon and Earth were the largest and knew this wasn't correct.  Because of that I was able to explain \"perspective.\"  Anyway, it's a good puzzle, well made, and the large size is fun.  I just wish it had longer-lasting value.  I think most children will pretty quickly outgrow 48 piece puzzles and this one will be of little remaining interest -- but of course it's impractical to start with 1000 piece puzzles, so we need beginning or intermediate puzzles like this for the short time that we're at this level.<br /><br />Now, while I agree that the puzzle's instructional value is as a puzzle not as a solar system diagram, the correct response to Pluto reclassification is to INCLUDE Kuiper belt objects rather than delete/omit knowledge. Because the asteroid belt was included, and Pluto was previously included in basic solar system knowledge, it's reasonable to expect Pluto and Kuiper belt objects on this solar system puzzle. In essence, if we learned something more about Pluto, then TEACH it, don't omit it. Additional knowledge is not a good reason to fail to teach what was previously proven not to be too complicated to learn.",,Well made,AEN35Z7JGYCSOJI6HOFKKUTL5SKA,true

0545647967,1,"",0545647967,4.0,"I purchased this for my cousin's daughter, who at six is considerably below the age recommended. In terms of skill I think she can handle the assembly instructions - one might object on the grounds of the pokey-stabby tool used for the felting, and while she did poke herself a couple times during the install, her parents fared considerably worse.<br /><br />Speaking of which; she produced a fuzzy friend (the bunny - purple, to be specific) within an hour of trying. The project went well, though her father managed to break two of the needles during the trial-and-error phase, so I'll have to replace those. She seemed to have some fun with it, especially since she was able to assemble the bunny with her parents. There is also a certain amount of observation involved - you have to watch and learn the art of felting, which I think is a good experience for a kid; obviously it didn't take too long, but then my sister was also assisting and she knows all about material/felt/stitching/quiliting and that sort of stuff.<br /><br />Overall, I would say it makes a good gift. It is, as described, easy to get into and produces a walnut to kiwi-sized fuzzy animal with maybe thirty-minutes of actual work.

Another cool feature is that all of the bubbles can't be popped in all at once.  I can get about half of them down before the they start popping back up.  Even though he knows that they can't all go down, he still loves trying over and over again.  The color combinations are super groovy and look really cool.",,Very satisfying,AHJYOD56GVUHGUW6NV4US7JR6NDA,true

1556344732,3,"",1556344732,5.0,"We've only had the game for a few days, but so far we've played it a total of six times, you figure each game is one hour long, so basically we've gotten six hours of fun for the affordable price of under twenty bucks.  So, way less than we'd spend if my family went out to see a movie and best of all, we didn't even have to leave the house.<br /><br />A little bit about the game, it seemed a bit complicated at first.<br /><br />We followed the directions, give each player four cards each from the two stacks, that part was basic, but we ended up folding and unfolding the game play instructions trying to figure out what to do next.<br /><br />Basically, each player tries to level up.  Levelling up can be achieved in just a few ways, 1. defeating a monster (which you can only do if you have enough levels, which means you may need to, 2. buy a level, by selling magical items or 3. get a level up treasure card.<br /><br />The game seemed a bit slow at first because each player starts with just one level which is too low to start fighting monsters.  But the game picked up when we'd all gotten to level three.  The monsters can be defeated by more than one player, so one minute I was sabotaging my son's chances at winning another level, the next we were fighting flying frogs together and sharing in the loot!<br /><br />The cards themselves give you directions, telling you to add 5 to fight a monster (very useful card to use against your opponents)  or that certain magical items can only be used by certain characters; dwarves, elves, etc.<br /><br />By the time we played a third time, we knew the game well enough to start levelling curses at each other and how to steal each others treasures.<br /><br />Munchkin has a lot of extender packs, munchkin zombie, munchkin the guild (I just bought this one, yay!) etc. that add to the original game set.<br /><br />Since we play a lot of games here at home, monopoly, settlers of catan, telepathy, zombie dice, risk, etc.  figuring out the basic rules wasn't terribly difficult, but I think looking at a few munchkin blogs could prove helpful (yep, there really are munchkin blogs.)",,A new game night favorite,AGLTXNHKNRY5SAZ62RG76WRBN75A,true

Colors are pretty standard, so she doesn't look like a clown in it. Cosmetic case also has a background mirror so she can see what she is applying.She also has sensitive skin and this makeup doesn’t bother her, which is definitely a huge plus. From dress up, to parties, or just princess time, there is alot of makeup in this compact little box.<br />Overall this is a nice cosmetic case with a handle that makes it easy for her to take with her wherever she goes.",,Adorable first makeup kit for your little princess,AHTLG4HMRAKA2PV64QS2LL2RSOHA,true

B001UKRXKO,0,"",B001UKRXKO,4.0,"I bought this placemat to help my 6 and 8 year olds work on telling time.  I also bought the special crayons that go with it.  The mat is a great idea.  I put it under their lunch or sometimes just give it to them and let them figure out the time as well as coloring a corresponding picture.  It's easy to erase and re-use, which I like.<br /><br />My one complaint about it is that there isn't much room on the edge of the analog clock for them to write in numbers.  I want them to practice writing in the :00, :15, :30, and :45, as well as the hours, but the dark edge on the clock as well as the closeness to the edge of the mat and the digital clock below doesn't leave much room for writing numbers in or makes them hard to see.  I wish they'd make a thick white or light colored border around the analog clock so kids can practice writing in the numbers where they would be in a real clock.<br /><br />**Also, unlike the other reviewer, I only received ONE mat for this price.  I thought the six for that price seemed like a good deal and ordered based on that review, but I now think her extra 5 were a fluke.  Don't count on getting more than 1.

While it's a fairly wide base, it really is a bit small for the scale, and doesn't really work that great. The flattened area where the figure can stand is pretty much as wide as the feet are, and just about as deep from front to back. It'll balance but you can't really do that much with a pose limitation like that.<br /><br />This would be incredible if it were slightly larger, imagine a Hot Toys Iron Man in the kneeling pose on it, or a pair of em with Zod and Superman getting all punchy. It'd be incredible.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because while it IS a bit on the small size for the display I wanted to do, it's pretty much perfect for anything that's Marvel Legends or DC Direct size (approx 7&#34; figure). I didn't give it 5 stars because the paint job on mine was a bit spattered, Nothing you can't fix with a quick splash of acrylic paint and a dry brush, but 5 stars is perfect, and having a flaw like that means it's not.<br /><br />If the company ever offers a bigger scale for 1/6 scale dioramas, I'll be first in line to grab one.",,"Pretty awesome, but not quite what I needed",AHADZZ4H377HDPU3MSGYC4JMBOVQ,true

However, they can be difficult to install and during install it is very easy to damage a wire making some or all of the LED's not light.  On this Sydney set I pinched a wire and 4 LED's would not light.  Luckily they were the ones I cared less about, but still unhappy that all were not working.  The same thing happened on two of the earlier installed sets.  The wires are very thin and easily damaged.  As careful as I was I still broke wires.<br />Also, it should be noted that the written instructions are printed poorly in a very small booklet.  Hard to read and too dark photos.  You can figure it out, but it takes time.  I discovered that Lightailing does have installation videos on line for a few sets.  Well worth the time to watch when available.  Makes proper installation much clearer.  All in all I am pleased with the Lightailing sets and the time and effort installing them.

It is so lifelike and such high quality, we are beyond pleased. Our story is bittersweet, and I feel the need to share because this dog has helped our family during a heart wrenching chapter. Our mother — my mother in law — was diagnosed earlier this year with dementia / Alzheimer’s and it has taken a huge toll on her. She is in assisted living and the change has been difficult for a number of reasons, including her accelerated decline and memory loss. The sweetness is about the dog, who resembles our dog, Sajha, whom my mother in law adores and loves. She calls Sajha her “friend”, and even though now she forgets most people and their names, she always asks about her friend, Sajha. Today we celebrated Mom’s birthday with our family and a dear friend. Our gift was this dog, since Sajha couldn’t be there.  We put a pink bandana and a birthday tiara on the dog (to match Mom’s birthday tiara).  Not a dry eye in the room as Mom started talking to and petting her friend, and was so happy to see her again. When we took the dog to Mom’s room, like always, she sat her friend by her side and continued to pet her and talk to her. Alzheimer’s is a cruel and heartless disease that does not discriminate, and when it took our mom, it broke our hearts. I am sure our mother’s, too. To find a “companion” that Mom can talk to in her moments of clarity and bouts of loneliness helps us have peace, too.  Mom loves her “new friend” and we are grateful we found this special dog at Amazon.  We now can fully recommend for folks with dementia as a calming and comforting resource.",,A wonderful and special gift for seniors,AG46MTLLYAH56FBGXVZLQB4DR4GA,true

B07P2DW2KW,34,"",B07V9PK3J6,4.0,"I bought this for my 2-year-old who loves to just press buttons and make sounds. It's very lightweight (he can pick it up himself) but sturdy so it won't break or hurt him if he drops it on his foot. The sound quality is great, and it's nice to not have a power cord dragging around that could get him tangled up, or replace batteries every few days.<br /><br />There are some built-in automatic rhythms/songs, and the ability to change instrument sounds with a few mashes of a button is thrilling to my child. On top of that, the piano keys are about 1/2 the size of normal piano keys, so they are great for small hands (so don't expect this to be very usable by anyone over 13 years old).<br /><br />There are 2 reasons I didn't give it a full 5 stars (mostly the 2nd one):<br /><br />1. It comes with a USB charging cable, but no adapter to plug into the wall. These days, most people have a couple USB ports in wall sockets and stuff, so it's not a big deal for most people, but it would've been nice to have.<br /><br />2. It doesn't retain the volume level when it goes to sleep and wakes back up. I love my kid, and I'm thrilled he has fun with this, but sometimes we will turn down the volume so his joyful cacophony doesn't give us a headache. However, a few minutes after he comes back to it, the volume is reset back to its initial LOUD volume. Given that it's a kids piano, it would be nice if there was a volume lock or something.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic product and cheap enough that you won't feel like one of those parents who spends tons of money on a toy or instrument that their kid might not end up liking.

The carrying case zippers ripped on day one (another reviewer said something similar).<br /><br />That said, it does serve the basic purpose and is fairly cheap, so if you're looking for something that is just better than the dining room table, this will do it.

B07HVT748J,24,"",B07HVT748J,5.0,"Okay, at the onset, I'd like to clear something up. This quadcopter is a great little quad. But, not for beginners. I will go into this much deeper, as an experienced flyer of both quadcopters and drones, I feel like I should offer some tips on flying this quad, as it is completely manual, with NONE of the control features you would expect of a true drone. (Which is perfectly okay. This quad is a TOY. A very good one, lots of fun, but still a toy. You should not expect it to do the kind of things a $2,000 drone does.)<br /><br />This quad is great for someone wanting to get their grit, on flying a 'by the stick' quadcopter. It's small, durable, inexpensive, comes with spare props, extra batteries and a simple instruction manual. The camera, legs and prop guards are easy to install.<br /><br />First thing that I noticed about the quadcopter is that this little guy is exactly like a pint sized Syma X8C, with the vertical hold, it operates just like a Syma X8HG. It came with three batteries. So, even though the batteries are only 3.7V, you still get pretty close to thirty minutes actual air time. Including time to change batteries and relaunch, you could have about an hour of fun time. Then, seeing that these batteries are fairly common, you can get spares and a multi-charger pretty cheap. This would make your flying time just as long as you want.<br /><br />Now, the quad's camera does NOT have a place for a memory card, so the only record of the flight will be on your phone, using the app. The app is quite good, offering a lot of features. I only used the video portion, using the transmitter for all directional controls.<br /><br />Now come the REAL flying instructions.<br /><br />Now, about flying this quadcopter. It is NOT for the beginner. An unexperienced flyer will lose it or crash it, guaranteed.<br /><br />First, before you put this bird in the air, I STRONGLY recommend that you print your phone number on some paper (in small but legible font) cut it out, put it face down on some tape (your making a label) and tape it to your quad. This quad is light enough that it does NOT need FAA registration. But, if you ever lose it, maybe someone will find it and call you. I've lost some quads before, and was able to get them back (sometimes) this way.<br /><br />If you are NOT familiar with quadcopters or flying them, INSTALL THE PROP GUARDS! You will need them to protect your quadcopter's propellers, motors and even the quad itself from damage. You will be hitting walls, the ground, trees, cars, people, and so on. HOT TIP!: Learn how to power on and power off the propellers BEFORE attempting to fly it. And, repeat turning it on and off several times before taking off. If the quad starts to get away, you will want to know how to shut the motors off and just let it fall to the ground. It's either that or just watch it sail away with the wind. Next, practice forcing the quad to the ground (preferably out in the yard where there's soft grass to land in). This is important because if you find your quad rocketing towards a dangerous encounter, you want it to go to ground instead.<br /><br />But, before you start flying, you have to do two very important things. 1) Set your trims. This can only be done in an area big enough to allow the quad to hover freely, like in an empty garage. Hovering at a fixed height is no problem for this quad, because of the very sensitive barometric pressure sensor. Whatever height you bring it to, it will remain there. However, all of the other movements are manually controlled and NOT managed by electronics. So, there are buttons on the controller that allow you to adjust the trims of the vertical, forward/backward, side to side and rotation of the quadcopter, while it is supposed to be motionless. In the garage (or other appropriate place with NO air movement) bring the aircraft to a hover, about three feet off the floor. If you see the craft drifting in any direction (in it's six axis controls) use the trim buttons to correct it, until it remains perfectly still. This is VERY important. Because, the ability to properly control the aircraft in flight, depends on how well it hovers on it's own.<br /><br />Next, after you have the quad well trimmed, you really need to learn how to keep it in a stationary hover, with your hands on the sticks at all times. Start out in the garage, with no air movement and keep your aircraft within an imaginary box of about 6 ft square. After you have mastered this, you can take it outside on a calm day and do the same exercise. Even on a calm day, there will be some air movement, so it will be a little more challenging. This exercise is important. It gives you more automatic and comfortable responses to manage the direction and heading of the aircraft.<br /><br />Finally, now that you've become very familiar with the quad and it's controller, you've practiced hovering and adjusted the trims, it's time to start flying.<br /><br /> If you don't have any experience flying a quadcopter that does NOT have GPS stabilization, you need to practice first, in a wide open area, away from buildings or trees. Keep the quad low, no more than 10 or 15 feet above the ground. When flying, out in the open keep the quad close to you, no more than 40 or 50 feet away. An open field with soft grass for landing (crashing) in is best. And, whatever you do, DO NOT let it get more than 15 feet up or 50 feet away. The higher it goes, and the further away, the harder it's going to be to correct any piloting errors and prevent a fly away. The altitude hold helps. But, without GPS stabilization, the quad can drift away before you know it. And, ALWAYS keep the drone facing away from you or in the direction of travel. This orientation is extremely important. If it's facing you, then left becomes right and away from you becomes toward you. It can be VERY confusing. The other controls, like auto take off and auto landing, headless mode, flips etc. should only be performed AFTER you have mastered the primary flying functions. This will help in navigation, as the quad will remain (somewhat) stationary when you want it to just hover. But, remember without GPS, it has NO HORIZONTAL PLANE STABILIZATION and will drift away if you let it. That's even on a windless day. Headless mode may help, if you have it set up correctly and it is functioning normally. Headless mode will always orient forward or backward to either away from you or towards you, no matter which way the nose is pointing. But, do NOT get to comfortable with this. The quadcopter does NOT know where you are or where the controller is. So, this function cannot be relied on too heavily. After flying for just a little while, headless mode may not function properly.<br /><br />Where to fly.... Well, obviously, in the house is not a good idea. Nor is in an alley, a small back yard, in the middle of the city, etc. You need a wide open area. Preferably, at least the size of a double tennis court or half a football field. Indoors, something the size of a basketball court is good. Outdoors, remember that this quad has a limited control range and even more limited video transmission range. It's also kind of a small craft and can be kind of hard to see at distances. So, in the open is great. But, DON'T let it get too far away. You should ALWAYS be able to see it clearly enough to know which way it's going. If this craft is anything like the Syma, it's control range is further than you can see it. But, don't test that theory.<br /><br />I have a collection of aircraft like this, that I have enjoyed flying for years. The one thing that I miss in this one is the onboard memory (micro-USB card) for a record of the flight that you don't have to watch the monitor for.  However, the record function in the app will give you pretty good 720p video and good pics, right on your phone. The fun thing about this quad is that it's not really an aerial photography platform OR a racing quad. It's a toy, designed to be played with. It's not the fastest. But, it will still do some pretty cool maneuvers like pirouettes, corkscrews, banking turns, strafing runs, altitude peaks, etc. and you can catch it all on video. Plus, if you crash, you're probably not going to break anything, as long as you do all of this in the right venue.<br /><br />Note: After you have become comfortable with this craft, remove the propeller guards. They add weight, using more power and draining the battery. They also reduce the maneuverability of the craft, making flying more difficult and crashing more likely. The guards are important to the inexperienced flyer. But, for those that can fly without fear of crashing, they are unnecessary and a burden.<br /><br />This review has been more of a tutorial on how to fly a basic quadcopter than anything else. But, you will appreciate it with this aircraft.<br /><br />Finally, I can tell you that this quadcopter is as good as they get. As I said, it's a 'Mini'Me' of the Syma X8C quad that has the altitude hold of the X8HG. It's durable, flies well, has good FPV and app, and is just plain fun. Pay close attention to how far it is from you and DON'T let it get more than maybe 300 feet away. Just remember that one thing, and you will enjoy this quad very much.<br /><br />There are a lot of versions of this quad out there. But, I know that the Benyi performs well, and is very much worth the investment. Good purchase. Five stars.",,Great quadcopter for experienced flyers.,AHTDYGXHONM2BHENDRMKMC34ZZZA,true

But, this little helicopter, purchased as a gift for a friend, proves to be a fun little bird. I wasn't sure if it was IR controlled or RF. It has IR on the controller. But, I opened it up and found a real RF antenna. Not a IR emitter. The instructions say for indoor use only. But, I took the copter outside on a relatively calm day, with about a 3-5 mph wind. Just barely a breeze. The copter had a hard time maintaining its location, and moved forward very sluggishly. So, yes, it's an indoor toy. This one is larger than most indoor heli's. So, make sure you have plenty of open space. It flies really well, right out of the box. I didn't have to do any trim adjustments. Very stable. The flight time is very good, for the size battery it has, a good 7-8 minutes. The 'search light' in the nose of the heli is a nice feature. It helped me keep orientation in the dim light. The controller doesn't make any beeps, chirps or boops to let you know if you are changing anything about the controller settings. But, that's okay too. Seeing that there aren't many changes you can make other than trim adjustment. So, all in all, this is a good toy heli.

It LOOKED perfect, but what about the reviews? They all seem to point to a happy ending, and this dress will lead you there.<br /><br />Selling Points:<br />*It's SUPER soft. No scratchy bits to irritate toddler skin. The fabrics are lush and thick.<br />*It's ON POINT - it LOOKS like Belle's dress. No pink sequins or ratty tulle here. It's stitched in the right places.<br />*It's WELL MADE. The stitching is not going to tear away any time soon.<br />*It FITS like it's supposed to. She's 18 months old and wears a 2T. This dress is a bit baggy, but I have a skinny Minnie, and it will grow with her.<br />*Even the TAG looks lovely. It's so much nicer than a Disney store, grocery store, Halloween buy. This screams quality.<br />*The PRICE is right. How did they get that price point? It's wonderful for our budget!<br /><br />My daughter opened her Belle dress on Christmas Day and hugged me. &quot;Mommy, real Belle dress! Beautiful dress!&quot; and she was right.

I found frogs for my cleaning bucket, and we adorned both cleaning buckets with our respective stickers. I found the ducks stickers to be prettily colored, and they did bring my friend a smile, making it worth the money spent. However, in regards to quality, these are a little above average, and don't adhere perfectly to any of multiple surface types tested. Fortunately, there is a large quantity of duck stickers, so when she lost one she had plenty of backups to replace them. At the time of purchase, the price was reasonable for the quality and quantity, but I'd hesitate to spend what is currently being asked. Overall, the ducks last awhile and don't scratch up or ruin easily, making them worthy of four stars.

B001445S4Y,2,"",B001445S4Y,5.0,"I like this Blue and White Turbo Troll Bait Bucket, #50114 - 8 Quart, by Challenge Plastics as an addition to my bait hauling duties.  It can be carried right to the Trough where they sell bait, filled with water and loaded up and then covered to avoid loosing any minnows or shrimp, even if tipped over.  When in the water at the side of the Kayak, it is easy to grab, open with a push of the hand and the top springs back closed.  I added a piece of small shock cord on the lid to pull it back closed and the minnow net is tied to the shock cord also.  I easily lifts onto the kayak for moving and then right back into the water again.  Easy!  And it effortlessly gives the little guys some more fresh water.  It drags a little if you paddle with it in the water, but not too bad.  I have a air bubbler stashed in the kayak with a 12 VDC lighter plug for on and off.  Easy!

I have play almost every Fallout video game to come out and it was time to get the board game. After watching a couple videos on how to play, I was very intimidated. There seemed to be a lot of moving parts, card decks and miniatures. My fiancé and I play a most of our games together and I was thinking this would be one that would be a little out of her comfort zone.<br /><br />I played through the single player game mode and enjoyed the game from the start. After the first game I knew the game was not as complicated as I thought. The game was so fun I stayed up till 3 am playing the game another 2 times. The next day I set it up for my fiancé and I, and I wasn’t disappointed. My favorite part of the game is the questing. The flavor and the ways you go about completing the quest feel like playing a video game. This is the closet I have come, in a board game, to a video game RPG. With hundreds of quest cards, the game replay is awesome. We both enjoyed the game and can’t wait to introduce it to our play group.<br /><br />I play a lot of tabletop games with miniature and the piece in Fallout are top quality. Before long they will be painted and looking great on the great design of the game tiles. It really feels like you are in the wastelands. For those of you that have played the games, look forward to the quest for the Wasteland Survival Guide! All of the cards are well designed and I really like the decks are different physical sizes.  There wasn’t enough room in the box for the insert and all the cards/game pieces. And there was not enough bags for all the game pieces, packaging could have been thought out a little more.

The chain lift should be tight around the gears, without even a tiny bit of slack. I have exactly two sets of 11 of those pipe pieces from bottom boarding station (green) to the top of the exit station (white), PLUS one entrance and exit piece so the total should be 12 pieces per side.<br /><br /> What I did: Start with the chain wrapped around both gears, but still open. Now, I lock the two end chains together while it's tightly wrapped around both gears. It feels like the link between both ends of the chain may not meet, but they will with a bit of effort (You may need to add or remove a link to accomplish this). That being said,  I've had perfect runs, with a super rare occasion that a marble goes rogue.  For $10.00 - color me impressed.  The chain is tall enough to get fairly intricate marble run going.

Not to mention unique with full body freckles! Even blushing on knees, wrists, elbows, neck, and bellybutton…wow. Her hair is a nice natural color for once mixing light blonde and strawberry blonde tones. Her eyes a blue green mix that is eerily life like. The lips are an interesting design choice and I’ve seen some variations in pictures with some more pronounced than others…they’ve totally grown on me though.<br /><br />I do worry about the fabric fraying with rough play as it is unhemmed and I’m not sure it’s treated fabric. But honestly she would look lovely in anything you want to redress her in. I miss the second outfit so much but this outfit definitely screams fashion which is the name of the series. I wish it did not come with hangers (instead have a purse or shoes or glasses??)…make it make sense. Also, she comes with makeup pallets and no brushes…make the accessories make sense please! My favorite accessory is the “working” sewing machine—this piece pushed me into buying her early—so cute!<br /><br />Overall I’m so impressed. I do not regret buying at full price at all and that’s saying something because I always wait for deep sales or clearance. She’s irresistible!!<br /><br />Edit: added a picture of the inside of the box. Honestly I don’t think it’s necessary to have such a large box and I don’t feel the inside art really matches the overall Rainbow High art style but I like the idea of the sketchiness as it matches the fashion design theme.<br />The hair is heavily gelled and needs careful combing or a wash. The tones closely resemble Georgia Bloom’s hair (slightly less orange) and Sabrina. Super soft hair and fun to play with. Still love her out of package and played with.

I really loved the pretty dimples of Blue Top Barbie. I hope to get another one soon. This one could even stand in flat shoes. Her ankles were just right. Some of the other Barbie Made to Move dolls had tricky little ankles with a mind all their own.<br />Also the peg inside their heads are slightly different, so the neck on one doll looks shorter now.<br />I just got Barbie Made to Move today. I read many reviews about Barbie Made to Move vs. Style Barbie. I just had to try her out. Most people who have the 2 dolls say Made to Move Barbie is a much better poser. This is very true.<br />I liked the rooted lashes and 2-toned hair on Style Barbie the best, so I can't say Style Barbie is a loser. Style also has the bending ankle and can wear both flats and heels. Made to move Barbie has choppy hair. I like it just the same, because my real hair is not all the same length. I thought it looked nice.<br />Made to Move Barbie can bend her knees all the way back and sit down on her knees. She can bend at the breast/ rib cage, but not at the waist. Style Barbie cannot do any of this.<br />Style Barbie can only bend her knees to sit down in a chair.<br />Made to Move Barbie can spread her legs out like in yoga or exercise class. Style Barbie can spread her legs very little in comparison.<br />Made to Move Barbie has much sturdier looking joints except in the ankles, they are almost the same. One thing I did notice was one of her ankles turns inward like she needs her electrolytes. I thought it was the shoes but I traded their shoes around and noticed the shoes were okay. I still like the natural looking poses for this doll. She is a much better choice for those who love doll dioramas and modelling clothes.<br /><br />As soon as I got her out, I noticed one small dot on her foot and face both barely noticeable. To me personally, this is not a problem, but I thought I should mention it. The price was well worth it for this doll. The clothes are nice enough and stretchy so I can go ahead and pose her. I had a couple of pairs of Barbie shoes to try on her.  She came barefooted. I was thrilled to find that her jointed ankle makes it possible for her to wear high heels and flat shoes made for Barbie. I have both branded and unbranded Barbie shoes that fit her. I was almost about to sell some of the shoes when I got her, but she is a keeper and loves shoes. The usual Barbie seams are kind of rough in places but that is okay, considering what I paid for her ($11.04). I consider this to be a really great buy.",,Best Barbie poser ever,AFC4JU2JAT5WGHKK4CIDWN25KDJA,true

B079K78K1C,13,"",B079K78K1C,2.0,"Mera is reasonably my favorite comic character and has been since I was a kid reading comics before bedtime.  I enjoyed her fiery mood and take no mess attitude.  I am glad to see that the movie adaptation has followed within this same arc.<br /><br />I was beyond excited to see that Mattel was going to once again be taking on Mera.  With my love of Barbie and Mera - this was a perfect matching and I had already purchased the Justice League Mera from last year and was overall satisfied with that doll.  I quickly purchased both the basic Mera and the Royal Gown Mera dolls.<br /><br />What an incredible let down.  The overall presentation of both dolls is a hyperactive mess of thrown together plastic, an embarrassing face mold and fashions that only match the screen worn outfits if you squint really, really hard.  Molten, conglomerated colored plastic doesn't look anything like the jellyfish presented within the film and the silvered coral top looks as though it was a discarded Holiday Barbie idea from 1992.  Obviously these dolls were created with play in mind but, a little more effort and attention to detail would have paid off.  I had really hoped that Mattel would take on Queen Atlanna as well and now I am glad they didn't as I would hate to see what tragic results would have come from that endeavor.<br /><br />What makes these dolls even more frustrating and confusing is that the back of the packaging shows what I assume is a prototype doll that actually looks like the actress and looks nothing like the physical doll packaged within said box.

And I got zero of the creatures of Sunblight except for 2 of the boss, which is supposed to be rare.<br /><br />Really weird selection of miniatures.<br /><br />Again, I realize they are random, but they could do a much better job of reducing the frequency of so many tiny and small minis and make key foes that occur in numbers more common. Not sure I'll ever buy a random box again.<br /><br />Also, the white dragon is painted light green... why?",,Really weird set of miniatures,AE6C7UK6RMOHFNT7NQJWSTPZQIRA,true
B0012N1JVI,0,"",B0012N1JVI,5.0,"Fair Warning: I'm just going to post this in all my animal items needing reviews unless one of them stands out for good or ill.  My son has a built up a heck of a collection made up of Papo, Collecta, and Schleich, and Safari Ltd. My son and I, or he and his friend, have enjoyed playing with them, some for several years. As there is often a predator-prey battle, there can be some violent collisions, &#34;clawing&#34;, &#34;pouncing upon&#34;, etc.  The Papo, Schleich, and Collecta are high quality replicas--all good build quality, durable, wonderfully detailed, a good weight and heft but not overly so, and they have held up without any issues (as mentioned, I'll note any exceptions in the individual review).  The Safari Ltd. have suffered the most from the treatment, though the vast majority of those creatures have come through relatively unscathed. I'd say they're lesser quality i both durability and craftsmanship, but they are more than adequate for playing even somewhat roughly with.  If it has thin legs, or other parts, it might be better to go the Schleich or Collecta, as they really are excellent build quality. But for creatures without a lot of appendages or thin parts (say, a beaver), the Safari are fine, if not quite as nicely made.<br /><br />The hyena is one of the better looking ones, especially in its posing",,"Fun to play with, nicely posed",AEJIPQY4UD6ZS2ATZPPUSQYEVSQA,true
B005YXFW2O,10,"",B0BZJWBVZ7,5.0,"Expansions are sometimes hit and miss, but Wizards Tower is a definite hit with our family.  It does exactly what an expansion should do--rejuvenate a game you've played for some time and enhance its enjoyment.  Wizards Tower completely succeeds.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) A small thing but a nice touch--everything that comes in the expansion fits easily into the original game's box.  We just transferred it all over and recycled the expansion box-no need to take up more space<br /><br />2) Monster variety.  The game adds more monsters, more cards, more boss monsters.  Even better, the new monsters add a lot of variety in that they have varying abilities and vulnerabilities. Some can be struck only by archers, some more faster, and so on.  The \"special monsters\" are even better. The Hydra, for instance, adds news monsters (imps) onto the board for every hit point of damage you inflict on it.  The dragon breathes fire at your defenses, the necromancer raises killed monsters, etc.<br /><br />3) card variety. The more difficult monsters are balanced out by the addition of some new Castle cars but especially by the addition of a Wizards Deck--each card in it allowing you to perform a spell that can do some damage (often across a range of monsters based on arc, color, spacing, etc.) or push monsters back. And it really is a nice balance, the spells aren't so uber powerful that they over-compensate for the tougher monsters<br /><br />4) requires more thought.  Because the monsters are harder and because some can only be hit by certain cards or move faster or do ranged damage, you really have to plan further ahead in this one as well as react faster on the fly.  The Wizard cards help a lot, but you can't simply stock up on them as there are several ways in which you can lose them by being forced to discard them (the Basilisk monster, for instance, requires all players to discard down to two cards). This is something you really have to plan around.You also have to plan around defending that Wizard Tower because once it goes, so does the ability to gain more Wizard cards.<br /><br />5) the way the game can turn quickly.  With the addition of imps, one-point relatively weak creatures, the game can really flip itself as imps sometimes appear based on a roll of a die. So you might end up placing a single imp on the board--no biggie, or you might end up placing six on the board (ruh roh).  The addition of goblin cavalry, who move two spaces at a time, can also turn the game quickly.  As can the ranged attacks.  There's really a greater feeling of instability which adds to the richness of game play<br /><br />We've always enjoyed Castle Panic with our originally nine-now-ten-year-old. We like the cooperative aspect, the planning aspect, and the fantasy aspect. All of us agree that the expansion has made an enjoyable game even more enjoyable.  A definite recommendation for fans of the game and if your'e buying the game for the first time or as a gift, I'd say pick it up at the same time and save it until you've played the original a few times.  But not too many as the game really is better with the expansion, no matter that it's pretty good on its own.<br /><br />Cons:<br />we haven't come up with any yet",,"great expansion, adds a lot of fun",AEJIPQY4UD6ZS2ATZPPUSQYEVSQA,true

B002RXAQKM,3,"",B002RXAQKM,4.0,"I bought this model for my 7 year old grandson who recently started riding and currently aspires to be a Vet.  The model is small and some of the bits are tiny but manageable if one has reasonable dexterity.  It is not for the easily frustrated as it requires patience and a thought to put together.  The documentation is marginally helpful, and we used the picture on the cover more that we did the provided sheet for guidance.  I also bought \"Horse Anatomy (Dover Nature Coloring Book)\" which proved a useful addition.<br />I worked with my grandson to put the model together for the first time.  One of the small pieces had molding flash still attached which prevented it from fitting properly until the excess material was removed.  The pieces will all fit together properly, but the final assembly is not terribly robust.<br />To reiterate, it was a bit of a problem solving exercise to fit the pieces into the correct spots, but we found the feeling of accomplishment worth the effort.  I do not recommend this as a quick-assembly toy.  There are better choices for that purpose.  However, I do recommend it as a learning exercise for the curious child.  It was fun to see my grandson made associations with his dog and human anatomy during the process.  The finished product is suitable for display in a safe spot and can be disassembled and reassembled as long as one keeps track of all the pieces (you wouldn't want to lose his pancreas, would you?).

If Team A consists of 2 people one member checks to see how many of the 8 words he/she knows and puts objects in a bin to add up to that number.  Then his/her team member listens attentively to the description of each word, trying to get the answer before the salt timer runs out.

B000O22V4C,1,"",B000O22V4C,4.0,"I ordered Penicillin and E. Coli for a friend who just graduated from nursing school, unaware that they had a graduation themed brain cell complete with mortarboard, but the two I bought are fun all the same. They are surprisingly well made, even the small ones (most come in different sizes, and it seems the smalls are all that's available on amazon). The string things on E Coli (I think they're called flagella?) are even heat fuzed at the tip so they don't fray so easily. The eyes are a little creepy, though. At first I thought they detracted from the theme of the toy, but they eventually became rather charming.<br /><br />I took off one star overall because I feel $9 is a bit much for a toy that small, and also because I wasn't aware there were larger sizes. The only other things I can find issue with are the fact that a lot of these are either stuffed balls or amorphous blobs. Only a subset of these toys are genuinely recognizable right off the bat. I picked the two that I did for this reason, because they had more character than most. There isn't much difference between the fat cell and the human ovum (yes, they have one, and a sperm, too)! Also, to be nitpicky, ants and ticks are not microscopic!<br /><br />Overall, these are great products, if a little expensive, and I'm thinking of getting a bacteriophage for myself and a heart worm for my dog to play with.",,great,AESMXMOUGEGOEIQWFWIACYN7NVOA,true

This was ordered for a 6yr old  boy so the pink one I received was not a good choice. Next, the anchor at the bottom for the strings was completely detached from the body.

B08DC16HHH,24,"",B08DC16HHH,5.0,"Deciding to purchase a toy fire engine for our Grandson, I read all of the many reviews that were posted for several other fire engines. Basing my decision on sturdiness, dependability, features, and realism, I chose this particular manufacturer. I gave an average rating for both Durability and Sturdiness since it's still new. Amazon's marketing graphics also contributed to this buying decision. Their photos of the fire engine, along with written descriptions of the operating features of this toy, convinced me I had made the right decision.<br /><br />The engine arrived today for our 19 month old Grandson. After I got my Grandson's attention, I took the fire truck from it's hiding place and, holding it in my hands, called him over. Upon seeing the fire truck, a huge, wide smile came upon his face as he walked towards me with open arms!! He held it in his arms as if it were his favourite friend! I showed our Grandson only once how to operate the buttons and he then knew exactly what to do! He \"drove\" it across the floor making engine sounds with his voice and was in toy haven!<br /><br />Frankly, after opening up the carton, I wanted to keep and play with it myself! I must say that I was very impressed with the packaging. The fire engine comes in a display carton with a large celaphane window. A city skyline is in the background. In the event that I needed to return it, I carefully opened each end of the carton. Surprisingly, the bottom of the fire engine was anchored to an insert with two quarter turn plastic fasteners that engaged the underbody of the engine, quite impressive. I removed these fasteners and set them aside. I was then able to carefully slide the engine out of it's container.<br /><br />Earlier, I took the opportunity to test the toy myself. Turning it over, I knew that the pull strip would permit the batteries to conduct power to the toy so I pulled it out altogether. I did note that there were some operating hints on the bottom of one of the packaging inserts. One showed how to fill the water reservoir for the fire hose atop the arial ladder. I also noted that the toy designer incorporated a quarter turn knob that, when turned, would permit the water tank to be removed, some good engineering here.<br /><br />Once full, I took it over to the sink and pushed down on the top center large button. Sure enough, a stream of water, quite strong, shot across the sink; it worked well! Then, I began experimenting with the buttons and controls on the sides of the engine. They all worked, emitting realistic fire rescue sounds along with flashing lights on both sides of the engine. At the same time, cabinet doors on one side opened to reveal realistic looking tools. With a forward gentle push on the front end, the front wheels became motorized and the engine shot across the floor with sirens blaring and lights flashing! This fire engine does it all!  Needless to say, this is the toy fire engine you should choose!<br /><br />(My only comment would be that the manufacturer could have included an illustrated instruction sheet showing the location of the various places you would press to activate certain features on the engine.<br />The large top button operates the fire hose. There is a lever on one side which will activate sounds and the front wheel drive if you gently push the top of the cab forward. The medallions on each side will also operate sirens and lights when depressed.)",,"Well designed, functional Fire Engine",AHFQUADX3PKOGTMDCJEJRRIT4DTQ,true

I did not want too big a kite but not as small as Prism's light wind 4d kite.<br /><br />I don't have a way to measure wind but if you can feel a breeze it will fly. In really light wind it does better on 50' line. I think 65' lines are the sweet spot for this kite. I let my nephew fly it and it survived two full-speed straight-down dives into the ground. The lines they come with are cheap. One of them broke the first day in not that strong of wind. The Prism lines I replaced them have held up really only breaking in winds I really should not have been flying in. The handles are nicer, the winders are nicer. Besides that the kite has met all expectations and I'm not going to dock a star for lines that come with a somewhat budget kite. The value is there, and met my expectations.<br /><br />Email support is not that good but phone support has been very good when I needed a lost part replacement.

That said, these EZ BioResearch Pre-poured Agar plates worked great for my child's science experiment.  Though they were poured on the thin side, they were thick enough to show growth from water that had been filtered using various filtering devices.  I was worried that they might dry out while being stored in the refrigerator until we were ready to use them, but they seemed fresh and clear of any contamination.  The sterile swabs worked great for our purposes.  The 10 plates and swabs gave us enough plates for two runs of our experiment plus controls.<br /><br />I would definitely use these again.

I'm a shade and shape person so I rarely even look at the picture on the box, but everyone else had to keep looking at the picture to figure out where the pieces went.

The pogo stick is very durable but certainly cannot deal with a grown-up's weight.  It's great exercise for her because she always gets a good work-out when using it.  I had a pogo stick when I was a kid and absolutely loved it.<br /><br />The only thing about this pogo stick which I think could have been done better and the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5, is that the handle could have been wider.  It's very narrow giving a small space for each hand to hold onto.  I think it would be easy for a kid to accidentally let go of or allow his/her hand to slide and lose hold of the bar.

It's now 3 days after Christmas and they still both love it.  Usually after the initial fun wears off (in a few hours) their toys sit unplayed with but not this castle.<br /><br />It's exactly what you see in the picture.  It's big and has lots of rooms, even a dungeon (of sorts) that constantly stir the imagination.  Sturdy wood construction, elegantly painted, it's quite a toy.  I wish I had one when I was a kid!  I also bought the Princess Disney characters others have mentioned instead of the Melissa & Doug characters and they work wonderfully with the castle.  I agree that the rooms are small, but I didn't buy this as a doll house for the girls to load up with furniture and pretend it's a real house.....it's a castle with a pretend moat, and dragons and shining knights in armor, and beautiful princesses and evil witches and all those imaginary things which make this castle so much fun to play with!<br /><br />Also, it's extremely easy to put together.  The only things you have to attach are the two towers and the connecting bridge.  It arrived very quickly in the mail and was well packaged.  I think it's worth the money and I'm about as cheap-minded as they come!<br /><br />UPDATE:  It's July 27, 2009 (7 months after purchase) and the girls both still love this castle.

Most all Nerf rifles fit. The really big blasters may not. You can hang pistols on the side too, although some of the 'hooks' that are prebuilt into the pistols may not fit on the hooks for their holes are too small. There is a shelf to store misc items such as magazines, etc, and a drawer to put all the darts to shoot. Overall this item does wonders to store the nerf rifles - instead of taking up space on the floor or shoving them in a large plastic tote bin, they can be stored vertically to take up less space.

We were scheduled for a road trip to see family over Thanksgiving, and I wanted to do something to make it easier for her.<br /><br />My wife has always had a fondness for pigs. So, I knew that the subject matter would be a slam-dunk win. The pig was placed on her seat while I was loading up the car (unbeknownst to her). When I was done packing it up, she came over, opened the door, and stopped. She smiled and asked, \"What's this?\"  She picked it up, hugged it, and squealed with delight!<br /><br />This pig could have cost $500, which would be worth that reaction. Thankfully, it didn't cost anywhere near that amount.<br /><br />It is about 16 inches, give-or-take, and arrived compressed in a tiny bag. But when I opened the bag and gave the pig a few hearty shakes, it uncompressed and expanded to be fluffy and soft. Something I didn't expect was a hole from side to side that you stick your hands through to not lose grip on the pig when you snuggle and fall asleep.

I was excited to receive this bird as I own multiple drones from Holy Stone. The new HS100 is the best one yet. It is their first GPS drone and it does not dissappoint. From the premium packaging, the easy and minimal assembly and clear instructions, I had her in the air as soon as the batteries were charged. The main battery is very similar in design to the Phantom battery. It is very high quality with a USB charging plug. I wish there were two batteries included, however a coupon was included inside for a free extra battery. Get this as it will double the fun. This is the first controller I have with also a USB rechargeable battery battery. The downloadable app installed on my iPhone with no issues and quickly and easily connected to the drone. No issues at all. After the batteries were fully charged, I took them to the park and an was in the air in less than two minutes. The GPS found the satellites quickly and the calibrations were very easy. I started off in the default beginner mode which kept her close enough to let me figure out the flight controllers. Within two minutes I switched off the beginner mode and the fun started. The camera and video are OK at 720 though there are better 1080 camera drones out there in this price range if that is what you are looking for. The flight times are very good with the supplied battery as I got around 12 minutes of flight time. As an overall package, this is a very high quality, solid built, stable and beautiful looking drone that is easy and fun to fly. Highly recommended for both the beginner and advanced pilot.",,A Holy Stone Masterpiece!,AEVLNG7Y3AL5L64VNWUXREBUR5VQ,true

She wanted something to help her with her hand dexterity, and has been putting together a large \"Block Toy\" display that is mostly composed of natural scenes blended in with an Urban backdrop. I figured this would be a nice hook to tie the theme together, and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />My sister relished putting this together. Absolutely enjoyed it. She constantly remarked about the level of detail in this set and how amazing it is. It took her a little while to put together and when she finished, she tied it to her pastoral scene with a couple of river base plates.<br /><br />I must not have read the description correctly when I purchased this, because my sister remarked something about this looking good with LED's. So I reached out to the seller, who not only replied promptly, but was exceptionally nice; who told me there are LED's in the kit, but would ship more if they were missing. Before I could ping my sister to tell her to check for the lights she texted, \"BRO! THERE ARE LED'S!\" ...<br /><br />Long story short. My sister is enamored with this piece, and it looks amazing in her setup.

Sturdy wooden pieces with various openings, functions, and tracks have provided hours of marble fun. Fairly sturdy although it can be knocked over but doesn't fall apart just because of a bump. It came with a book with various maze set ups with easy step by step instructions that my son was able to do with just a little help. Great way to get the mind thinking in engineering cause and effect ways. Love this and will be purchasing the additional tracks and add-ons. We bought the Xcellerator and Round About to start.

I have had more opportunity to play with this Möbii Daydream.  I am loving it!  Even though I do have small hands, this feels great in one or both hands. The thicker rings feel so nice and smooth, and the movement is wonderful!  I had to order another one before they were all gone.  The lighter weight of the aluminum is ideal for me. Meanwhile, the hubby enjoys the heavier Deep Thought. I highly recommend this Daydream.<br /><br />Original review:<br />To begin, I have purchased each of the following (many in multiples):<br /><br />Möbii Daydream, Deep Thought, Half Thought, Medium Möbii, Medium Stainless Steel Möbii, Small Möbii, Small Stainless Steel and Copper Möbii, Anodized Aluminum Spin Ring, Stainless Steel Spin Ring.<br />(All except the Small Stainless Steel/Copper Möbii and the Medium Stainless Steel Möbii are pictured above basically in the order they are listed.  The two not pictured are the same size as the other Small and Medium Möbii and are well represented with the seller’s pictures.  And, please ignore the busted knuckle from yard work. :) )<br /><br />If you are like me, and like to comparison shop using reviews, I hope the inclusion of each item is helpful. That said, for simplicity, I will be copying and pasting the same review on each of the items I have purchased.<br /><br />While the Daydream is a bit large for my hand, it works because it is so lightweight. The individual links/rings are thicker than the Medium and Small Möbii, and I like the feel and movement.<br />The Deep Thought is nice and heavy with a good feel to it. I purchased it as a gift to my husband. It fits well in his large hands, and he seems to like it.<br />The Half Thought is wonderful!  It is definitely one of my favorites. It has wonderfully simple and smooth unending movement. The weight is just right. It does make more noise than the tighter fitting Möbii fidgets—I mean, they’re stainless steel rings. The noise doesn’t bother me, and it’s basically as loud as you make it.<br />The Small Möbii fidgets are really nice for discreet fidgeting at meetings, etc., and they work well for just fingertip fidgeting. The colors are vibrant, and the customization option is a lot of fun!<br />The Small Stainless Steel and Copper Möbii is really nice—another favorite!  The weight is great, and the movement is very smooth. I really like the copper mixed with the stainless steel.<br />The Medium Möbii fidgets probably get the most use (yes, another favorite) because of the perfect size, nice movement, and fun colors. They are lightweight and quiet (not silent).  I do also have a Medium Stainless Steel Möbii, which, of course, has a little more weight to it and a good feel. The Stainless Steel version probably has slightly better overall movement. Although, I do still tend to pick up the brightly colored Aluminum version more often.<br />The Spin Rings (Anodized Aluminum and Stainless Steel) are both wonderful, whether you wear them at the base of the finger or in the middle—depending on fidget preferences. Of course, the Stainless Steel version is heavier. I really like both. I like more rings per spin ring for fidgeting and spinning, but obviously, more rings make the entire ring much thicker.  If I wear a thick ring on my right (dominant) hand, it tends to interfere with writing. I usually just switch hands or set it aside.<br />Everything I’ve received has been very well made and delivered in a cute little Möbii-branded bag. As other reviewers have stated, the personal, hand-written “thank you” note is a nice touch. I had a few large orders, and the seller even included a free Small Möbii in two of the shipments!!  I was super excited!  (Geoff, I hope you’re reading this:  Thank you so much!!!)<br />These make great gifts and have been a hit with my family and friends. I am addicted!  I highly recommend any of these Steel Lynx products, y’all!! You can’t go wrong!",,Dreamy!,AH3LVZFZHMLZP5GP3RAGEXTGAUHQ,true

Also, your taco/burrito ends up with all these weird cards (why would you want month old sushi or an eyeball or a mustache hair in your food?!) and you are constantly giving tummy ache cards back and forth to your opponent. The taco/burrito stands don't stand up, either, even on their own without the weight of cards in them.

I don't mind this and neither does my son but if that will be a deal-breaker for you, it's better that you know now.  If you squeeze one ear, the horse sings and the mouth moves.  If you squeeze the other ear, a random saying will come out.  My son loves pressing the ears and then hurries to kneel down and watch the horse's mouth move.  He loves hugging this little guy and when he prefers to rock on it, he will bring me the base so I can put it back on- which takes a whole 2 seconds; you just set it down on top of the rocker base, pull the plastic piece over the front bar and close until it clicks. Voila!  To make it a rideable toy again, you simply push the button and the plastic piece pops open to release the horse.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this little horse for 1 year olds and up.

Packaging says re-issues.<br /><br />Not really my favorites as they are not as bulky per man (they arent overly thin either like department store ones) or as detailed as some that are a bit  more expensive.  They are however, fairly detailed and out of the 96 none had any  defects.  These are a tad bit softer plastic than some other brands....not an issue to me.

Heavy Barrel & Burger Time were favorites of mine back in the day.

Being able to hook this up to a television is another plus for me.<br /><br />Now, for some of the issues I have. First - the screen outer cover was misaligned on the unit I received. I was able to carefully pull it off and correct the placement of it on the device. Second, this game system has two main buttons, A& B plus Reset & Start, along with a directional pad. Problem is, with some of the other games you are missing buttons that you need. For instance, with the Sudoku game (#266) you can't access the control buttons in the game to check the puzzle or get hints. I've got one of the My Arcade game consoles with the wireless remotes, and it has the same library of games on it and the same Sudoku game. The controllers for that system have more buttons, and you can access the controls for the game.<br /><br />So I like this handheld game system, but it's not perfect.

A couple are similar (we got two tow trucks and two race cars and two fuel/tanker trucks but even so they are very unique in their own right).<br /><br />THE BAD -<br /><br />Not necessarily bad but a negative at first - they are new and tight and hard to pull apart at first.  (Next time we put them together I’m going to try a bit of bar soap or something to help get them apart later so I don’t have to pry them apart with a butter knife eventually).

It's just annoying, every turn can last forever, and I constantly had to be checking the instructions to see what we have to do now, there are so many places where the players each have to stop, and then you need to do a whole bunch of things till it's the next persons turn. For example you stop at graduation, then pick from the cards of jobs. Then you spin again, and then if you pass payday you need to get paid, and then if you land on the action square you need to pick a card and follow directions, sometimes involving one or more players and spinning etc. so a single turn can last five minutes, while all the other players twiddle their thumbs and annoy their mom.<br />if it sounds confusing, that's because it is. The banker can barely keep up, paydays every minute, there's also a bonus that if someone spins your number they need to pay you, who can keep track when there is so much going on??

This mini delivers on that.<br /><br />He does feature a prominent flame spell effect, which was a bit of a problem for me since my character favors lightning, but with some blue & white I managed to make it work.<br /><br />The detail is great and this mini is, unlike so many these days, metal.  He has a number of individual belt pouches, a dagger at his belt and the hand not being all flashy in the front is quietly slipping a scroll out of a scroll case in the back.<br /><br />Due to the detail and high quality, I will definitely seek out similar Reaper minis in the future.<br /><br />This is the first mini I've painted, and I had a ton of fun with that.

B009F7OTIS,1,"",B009F7OTIS,4.0,"Pros: My 5 yr old granddaughter had a lot of small mermaids and their friends but no set to play with them.  She really enjoys this set, which can be played with in the tub or on a table.  The suction cups are large and hold very well. On a table or the floor it is just as stable as in the tub.  The set itself is well made and I would recommend it.<br /><br />Cons: The cons are small and certainly none that would make me wish to send it back.  It's not quite as large as I thought  (The picture of the little girl with the tiara made me think that it was larger. The little detachable comb tiara looks ridiculously small on a five year old's head).  The only other con is that the little bottom pool has no drain.  One has to make sure that to detach it from the wall and pour the water out after bath time.<br /><br />All in all, I wasn't disappointed.  It was a big hit, which is what counts the most.",,My granddaughter loved this set,AEFRS54KUOKCFC4TCLZOCCXNV62A,true

It has given me pause a couple of times because it has a very serious, fierce Cheetah face. Angry even. This isn't your garden variety Beanie Boo or cute puffy kitty plush. This is a predator and it lets you know it.<br /><br />Way back when I was a kid, back when we wore newspapers around our feet instead of shoes to trudge to school in 18 feet of snow, I had a panther like this. It was all black and scary enough to send the house cat running full speed out of the room with a puffy tail. I loved my Bagheera so dearly, like my daughter loves this Cheetah. Some sort of magic happens when little girls receive a giant stuffed cat for the Christmas of their 8th year. Alas, my Bagheera crossed the stuffed animal Rainbow Bridge many years ago, but he will always be fondly remembered.<br /><br />I am very happy that my daughter is also able to shower her love on a giant, regal stuffed animal like I did as a kid, when we lived without electricity or indoor toilets, and my only source of heat was snuggling with my stuffed wild cat. I always took my Bagheera to the outhouse with me in the dead on the night to scare off the wolves, coyotes, and wild boar. That I am here writing this today is evidence that my stuffed cat had a huge impact on my young life. I have no doubt that this Cheetah would also do a great job of deterring bears and badgers on a late night stroll to use the toilet. Thankfully my daughter will never have to deal with such harrowing circumstances, but nevertheless, even if its only job is to sit in a room looking majestic, I highly recommend that you gift this Cheetah to a lucky kid.",,This Cheetah is Fierce!,AENPOINHZF7AQYKGKVIH7S5UYVTQ,true

We took that truck to the beach every weekend. This replacement truck bed is metal, it's massive and I know he's going to love it! The wheels and cab are plastic, but it appears to be really sturdy. I like the handle on the dump bed. No sharp edges and it keeps the bed in place - doesn't tip back. It's well worth spending a little extra to have a truck that won't fall apart. For our use - sandy beaches - we'll be able to push it, fill it up with dirt, put water in it and wash it off before we head home. Love it.

It is too frustrating for some, but that still provides a learning experience and they get to help me with color ID (the blue and green spots on the die look alike to me).

B00TTU9RAQ,1,"",B00TTU9RAQ,4.0,"When they hear it switch on, they will all jump down from the bed upstairs and come running downstairs to play with it. The downside is they will chase it under the stove, behind a cabinet, under the couch, and generally places that are a pain to retrieve it from. That has limited how often we get it out for them to play with it, but when we do, they are obsessed. Lots of reviews say the battery life is horrible, so I got the extra batteries, but we are still on the original. Granted, we don't leave it out all day for them (it isn't a loud toy, but when it goes underneath something and starts vibrating against it, that can be very loud).<br /><br />Full disclosure: on the second or third day of having this toy, one of our cats bit down on it, causing one of the legs to come off. The legs are tiny and not a choking or digestive concern, but this made it unbalanced, causing it to go in tiny circles and not move in straight lines anymore. I was able to find Hexbugs made for kids in the toy section of a local big box store, but without the fluffy tail. This makes the bug even more likely to go underneath things, so stick with the fluffy tailed version!",,Our cats LOVE this little toy,AF3PR6C3MCEBN7UHG43GJNJAYSUA,true

I didn't attempt the fairy face, though it doesn't look too hard when you have step by step illustrations. The paints wash right off with warm water and soap leaving only the faintest of lines if you don't wash it off well enough. None of the children I practiced on had any allergic reactions to the paints, so I'd say they are mild.

B008A2BA8G,1,"",B08TD1Y1W7,5.0,"This game is addicting and so much fun for ages 10+.  The teenagers at the summer camp I run especially found it fun.<br /><br />The short version of how it works: Everyone gets an identity (spy or resistance member).  Spies get to see who the other spies are, resistance members are clueless.  You take turns choosing people to go on missions hoping that you don't have a spy among your group.  Everyone on that mission turns in a pass or fail card.  The spies are trying to get missions to fail, and resistance members are trying to pass the missions.  You have 5 mission rounds to battle it out.<br /><br />The first round or two playing with new people is always pretty quiet and awkward, but once everyone catches on to how to play, and opens up the game becomes a blast!  It's been a great ice breaker for us, and it's got the kids talking and making friends with each other.  All while being deceitful, calling others out for being spies, but overall having fun!<br /><br />It's definitely more fun the more people you have, but it's still playable with only 5.",,A must have party game!,AFB43KPC2KIIORBIGJP24SEWCSIA,true

The illustrations are beautiful and while the animals and names might be advanced for kids younger than two, babies four months or older will still love the colors and want to get their little hands on them.  Truly, everything that my wife and I have purchased from the Eric Carle library has been a huge hit with our son.  Carle has a way of using paint and paper to create movement and excitement in every piece.  These cards, in particular, have several advantages.  We were thrilled with the size and thickness of them (if you're a parent, then you'll understand the desire for slightly larger and more substantial items that are intended for child's play.)  They also come in a cute little box that makes them easy to store.  The animals that Carle has chosen to illustrate range from extremely common to somewhat eccentric.  In fact, two or three are well off the beaten path when compared to other children's games - we really enjoyed this.  Of course on the opposite side of the animal illustrations are custom drawn, but easy to read alphabet letters (uppercase and lowercase)...and the colors and textures resting behind the letters are absolutely and uniquely Carle, appearing playfully course, fibrous, and unprocessed - naturally beautiful!",,Eric Carle - Always a good choice,AE7JULGBIT5N7ER6K6GJLFMMVFXQ,true

Even if you're not a fan of Bioshock or have never heard of or even played the video games, there is lots to appreciate in this strongly thematic strategy board game. The units are wonderfully detailed; the cards are rich in their art work; the quality of the board and all the components are top-notch, making one see the $80 original price the game once had; and all the components flow in a very satisfying way. The gameplay itself is surprisingly deep as well, allowing the players to upgrade their battle cards, take risks with different movements along the board's &#34;rails&#34;, and think ahead. It's similar to risk in that you conquer territories, but all the extra strategy elements take the game to a different level.

B01HWDQ5AG,4,"",B01HWDQ5AG,3.0,"If you need a remote controlled unit for your child, your options are limited and I would buy this one again. Putting it together took about ten minutes. You will need to drill the rear axle out because the holes don't line up, but its basic.<br /><br />In high gear the jeep goes a little faster than walking speed which is good, but in lower gears it has literally no torque. It barley climbs our driveway into the garage. Our driveway is a normal suburban neighborhood driveway/not steep. Our friends child has a barbie jeep from Walmart and it is so much more powerful than this thing.<br /><br /> Another irritating thing is the remote control. If you use this thing for twenty minutes you have to hold the button down the entire time, and the button is not a nice one. Its not physically hard, just more annoying. Its hard to keep your finger in the right place to press.<br /><br />Another important thing is to look around for the lowest price. When we were looking for one of these we found the same jeep from the same seller with five or six different prices. A little clicking saved us hundreds of dollars.<br /><br />To be clear. My 2yo son loves this thing. All the lights are cool, the stereo and horn are fun for him.The electronic features of the jeep are good. Its just weak.

It does that, does it well, and comes with TONS of minis, missions, etc. That said, it's designed very well, the characters in this version stand up very well to the mobs/missions, but for some reason unlike some other games we own, the kids don't get immersed in it as well. It just kind of feels linear and you feel lead along. Maybe I need to work better at narrating or something, but that's just my 2 cents.",,"I really liked the idea of co-op.

B002IUFSPM,0,"",B0BZFFF37J,4.0,"I purchased this game with the intention of playing with my 5 year old daughter, wife, and possibly my 4 year old son. This has proven to be a great game. I don't think most avid gamers would find it as fun, simply because the design is you play against random board mechanics. Some real bad draws and no matter how good you are, you just can't beat it. Other times, it's skill and other times it's just luck of the draw.<br /><br />That said, this game is EXCELLENT! There's no heavy competition (unless you use some of the modified rules). Basically, everyone WINS or everyone LOSES. That means my daughter's not nagging her brother, etc, etc. It's a great family game for this reason where it is cooperative. The theme is also the fun part, while you're playing, you will have nail biting times, and easier times, etc. We just purchased it and have played it over 5 times in the last week. My nephews have come over and played multiple times too. It's also great because it can host up to 6 players, which is excellent!<br /><br />The only downfall I've seen is this. Avid gamers might not like it as it's light in strategy, meaning it's easy to play (almost self guided at times). Also, this game can be harder to play at certain player numbers. For example: 2 players each player has 6 cards, and that's 12 total to look at. With 5 players, there's 5 x 5 hands meaning 25 cards making the odds alot better. Basically 2 and 3 player games can be rough. Lower player games aren't unwinnable, it's just higher difficulty (which again is mostly random). Out of 5 stars I definitely rate this a 4. i would give it a 5 if it wasn't so random (meaning hopeless on some games). By the way, out of 5 games played, we've won 4...so it's not 'that' hopless really...great game!!!",,Castle Panic great for younger players too!,AG34TKNGBARLNDSAMTOYYKYPVVTQ,true

This thing is great! Thousands of bubbles most just under tennis ball size but some smaller. If you use the Gazillion Bubble solution you get beautiful iridescent bubbles that drift a long way before breaking. It works best and the bubble sdrift farther if you can get it up off the ground. A breeze helps too. I set it on the top step of a 3-step ladder and that was perfect. This machine is a bubble solution hog but it couldn't be any less and produce this volume of bubbles. Seems to run maybe 20 minutes or so on a fill and you get about 4 fills from a bottle of the 2 liter Gazillion Bubbles solution. It can make a but of a mess on the ground under the machine so be sure to place it somewhere that doesn't matter or is easy to clean. I didn't find the machine all that difficult to clean after using but you have to have a little patience. Hold it upside down and use the garden hose on low flow to wash out the solution tray being careful not to wet the motor or switch.. We ran this off and on over the 3 day July 4th weekend and it ran perfectly. Kids and adults both were amazed. If you want a bubble machine and don't want to spend a lot of money get this one.,,Wow!

The assembly screws are very small, but the small magnetic screwdriver is a huge help! Had some difficulty with keeping the timing belt on the cam pulley; took several tries.

B004ALKLR2,0,"",B004ALKLR2,3.0,"Didn’t stick together as well as I thought? The small beads were difficult to keep together for some reason and the way it was packaged, you had to store them in something else all separately of course or the colors will combine. It’s hard to separate the colors too after you put them together so if you try like the tree for example, some of the brown ones mix with the green and don’t come apart unless you want to take each small bead out one by one which is crazy. So I can imagine after playing with them for a wile the colors would get combined.<br />I thought however a good way to store them was in large Easter eggs. Since it was close to Easter that worked great for us since the clear pods are only for packaging and once you open it they are done.i wouldn’t get these for really small children under 4 unless you want to have a mess or be with them the whole time and watch them very closely but good for older ones if they are responsible enough.

These Battle Giants cost about 10-11 of your 15 value team points, so it will be hard to build a team around them. However, they have high health and hit for a lot as well. They also have an armor piece that pops off when they are hit in the chest for the first time. They will \"Split Strike,\" or split in half, when hit in the chest a second time. It was actually pretty hard to get a decent Split Strike in on these guys since you have to hit them twice.<br /><br />It was also hard for my boys to mash the button on this new type of controller - especially as the instructions say to use only two fingers...even with their full hand, it tired them quickly. The Giants do fit on the other types of controllers so we used those for them in later battles.<br /><br />Our Drillborg came unconnected to his blue base (similar to how some of our other warriors came) and we had to super glue him back on. The armor pops on and off easily, but it did become a battle of not losing it after playing many rounds of fighting... especially as it sometimes popped really far away.",,Fun addition to Series 1 Akedo Warriors,AFYLZFXFVY3YDTEJKPAY3JKPC7BA,true

We tried reattaching it with e6000 and hot glue, etc. But it keeps popping off.

The tree itself comes in two pieces and snaps in to the brown base part. He LOVES spinning the tree itself, while the base stays still. The star is also removable and he loves putting it on and taking it off while saying \"Star.\" Aside from the spinning of the tree and the star, he could care less about the ornaments or the train track at this time. Every time we put the ornaments in the slots on the tree, he punches them off.  It is the only time he will play with the ornaments (aside from carrying them around the house), but I can definitely say that the ornaments are durable! We play \"whack-a-mole\" with the ornaments - mom and dad puts the ornaments on the tree and he spins the tree and punches them out.  The ornaments do fall off the tree easily because it can spin, but he really likes that part so I guess I can still call this purchase a win.

My son was terrified of the tunnel piece, at first, until we showed him how to use it and crawl through it and still see us.  We left the pieces apart and introduced them one piece at a time, with the ball pit first and then the tunnel and, lastly, the play house.  An adult can sit in the playhouse, but it will be a tight fit.  My son never warmed up to the play house part, but his cousins (his age) loved playing in there.  I also love that you could fold parts of the play pit in so that it became a smaller ball pit when it was just him by himself. We bought 500 fisherprice small balls to fill the pit.  I believe they were between 4-5 inches. Some balls are considerably smaller and will not fill up the space.  500 was a nice fill, but not deep like we would've liked.

Love the thin, kind of gangly look, which reminds me of many of the great Spider-man artists who have drawn him over the decades.

For those of you who can't spend $150-$500 on a porcelain statue, these vinyl statues make a great, affordable option.  I do wish they would make each a limited run like DC does with many of their vinyl statues (at still under $50).  Offers a little extra value to the buyer that way.

We Didn’t Use The Lights Because I Didn’t Have AA Batteries on hand. :(  It was easy to inflate and assemble, but definitely give yourself 20-25 minutes to do so. I am so glad I assembled this while at my house. It didn’t come with a straw which is necessary to use while trying to inflate. I had some skinny metal ones on hand which helped. You just find the valve hole on each balloon, stick your straw in and blow. While you pull your straw out you pinch and there is adhesive on the inside! I was excited about the Size of this Banner! I did have a couple of letters that didn’t want to hold their air as well, but it was only a slow leak so it didn’t look too bad.. hoping we can reuse them. Are they worth it?

B001W2WKS0,31,"",B001W2WKS0,4.0,"I purchased this in an attempt to interest my daughter (she's 3.5) in learning and writing her letters and numbers. Some days she really tries to write the letter, and some days she just wants to scribble. One level 1, it cheers you on no matter what you write, on level 2 it is more challenging and she's not ready for that. I think it would be better if the level 1 recognized she wasn't even trying to write a letter and said something like, &#34;that's okay, try again&#34;. Or something along those lines. But this is a really neat toy and has helped with her interest in learning. We also practice writing on paper. I like that the stylus has places to grip to teach proper pencil holding. I think when she's 4 she will use this more and hopefully be more ready to actually try to write.<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br /><br />It's been 4 months of play and I wanted to update.<br /><br />The original batteries are still going strong. My daughter is writing letters more and more and really trying, but she gets frustrated and just scribbles sometimes. She can do Level 2 now but when she gets frustrated she switches back to Level 1. Right now she is focusing on the 'easy' letters and numbers and doesn't attempt the more difficult ones. But she has come a long way in 4 months! This toy has really helped her learn to hold her pencils, crayons, etc properly and helping her hand-eye coordination.<br /><br />This is great to take to places where you might normally let your child play with your tablet or phone.

They color like a cross between a traditional pencil, and a fine-tipped wax crayon - and the results you can achieve are fantastic!<br /><br />I have been able to use just a simple pack of only 12 colors, to make bright and vivid pictures in adult coloring books, and I am really happy with how these &quot;pencils&quot; can bring a picture to life.<br /><br />They do start out with a square tip, so you need to color on some scrap paper to form some edges and points to help you color. This and the fact that they aren't easily used for shading, are their only downside. Other than that, I really love them!<br /><br />I have found them to be sturdy and have not had one break, and they are easy to hold and maneuver. When you have colored the tip down, they are easy to twist up more of the color - and the clear barrel is great for seeing how much of the pencil you have used/is left. (I still have a LOT of coloring to do before I'm at risk of running any of the colors down :)<br /><br />I do recommend them for adult coloring and I can see how they would be good for older children who are able to understand the importance of not twisting them up too far or recklessly.

The netting is very fine so small insects can be kept inside, but opening the zipper on the top to feed the insect or provide water as in the form of a cotton ball, involves violently shaking the entire unit, disturbs the bugs, and of course, causes many insects to head toward the top of the enclosure. Of course, the zipper is also at the top. I keep Ladybugs in my habitat for my Venus Fly Traps and to kill Spider Mites that appear at times on my house plants. To keep them alive, I have to put a wet cotton ball inside, along with mashed raisins. There is not a an issue with the raisins because I put them on a little paper cup that is easy to use and then dispose of when the raisins are dry. The cotton balls, however, have a tendency to soak through the paper cups and then right threw the bottom of the cloth habitat floor as well. It can be quite messy!

It comes with cute hair bows, and the hair is actually good hair to be fixed into different hair dos. My 14 yr. old daughter actually has 'played' with this more than the little ones so far. She spent over an hr. last night creating different hair styles for Elsa. (I have attached photos to show the hair isn't made cheap and it can be styled).<br /><br />This item would be good for a child such as my little ones. But it also is a good product for older girls to practice hair styles on. We were thinking we wished we would have gotten this styling head before Halloween since we had blue temporary hair color for my 14 yr. old's costume. We could have tested the hair color on this Elsa since the hair color is washable and we could have figured out the style for my daughter's hair by using Elsa as a 'model'. LOL<br /><br />Overall, we are happy, the Elsa is made well, comes with accessories and it keeps the kids entertained. I plan on purchasing the Anna that is just like this Elsa for my 5 yr. old.<br /><br />Also, I recommend purchasing this Frozen hair styling kit to go with this Elsa styling head [[ASIN:B00TQPIL10 Frozen Hair Styling Tote Playset]]<br />The little hair styling kit comes with a brush, hair bows, toy make up such as lip stick (not real so no mess), perfume bottle, a curling iron, and a hair dryer that actually blows out air which my daughters thought was the greatest thing ever invented. The little hair styling kit completes this styling head, and it gives the child plenty of stuff to use on Elsa so they don't get bored quickly. It only cost around $14 so between the 2 play sets you would have around $35 in the toys but it's well worth it. I wouldn't purchase the Elsa head without the hair styling kit/play set myself.<br /><br />Note: The butterfly hair clip that is clipped to Elsa's hair in the photos attached does not come with this styling head. We already had the butterfly hair clips (also purchased on Amazon LOL).",,Great product for older and younger kids!,AEKFFW2A5JUFHR5KTBRX55IT4S5A,true

It seems well-built and child-friendly.  I feel like it will last my child quite a while.  I loved how they made the viewing space extended so that it gives support on both sides of the child's head.  This allows my son to more easily position and hold his eyes in the correct place while trying to view an object.<br />I was disappointed that the telescoping power was so weak.  It allowed me to see things more closely that were only about 20 feet away.  If I could walk that far in just a few feet....then what is the point?  I was hoping to be able to use it for bird watching.  Also, the magnification was sharp but the image was tiny.  I could only see about a 1/2 in. of the image, the rest of the space surrounding it was blurry.  I would have to position my eyes exactly before, I was able to see this small image.  I think this made it very hard for my child to see the object.  This would work for an older child (9-13) or an extremely patient 7 year old but for my rambunctious 5 year old boy.....it was a no go.<br />He does love taking it out and about on walks with him.

They loved it and enjoyed learning their alphabet from the little songs and easy to use letter plates. When we were surprised to find out we were having another little person (with teenage boys in the house) I k ew this would be a great learning tool for my newest addition.<br />Um, no. Not impressed. The first one that was shipped was missing a letter plate. It was quickly exchanged for a new product that had all the letters.<br />The problem I am seeing (and had never seen with the version my boys had when they were little) is sometimes (a lot more than I would like to admit) the letter plate when placed on the pad, will sing a song for the WRONG LETTER.  I am not kidding. Watch the video I posted!!<br />My daughter will be playing with it, place a letter X and the toy will sing a song for another letter entirely. Once it was singing the song for “M”.<br />I have since figured out that if you dont push it right from the center it plays the wrong song... I am disappointed as small children could EASILY be confused and learn the wrong letters and sounds.<br />Isn’t this the whole point of this toy? To help teach letters and their sounds?<br />Knowing that I sound just like my mother and even, dare I say, my grandfather... they just dont make things like they used to.

Luckily the peanut-scented Num Nom is motorized and spins around in a circle, otherwise I think he would have abandoned the whole set on the spot. He played with the peanut for several hours, so I expect the battery to be dead very soon! I can see how this would be a cute toy for a GIRL (especially for a birthday party or sleepover.)  I'm sure it would be entertaining for the girls (probably ages 4 to 7) to stack the Num Noms to make different &#34;recipes&#34; or trade them with each other.

To be fair- it might be hitting that area of the face because they are smaller than recommended , but maybe the plastic could be rounded or smoothed to prevent this? Also, some parents recommended having them use their bike helmets during play. This is a good idea especially if you are playing outdoors- our boys like rolling down our slight backyard hill. The last thing is that the balls can possibly lead to \"not happy anymore\"<br /> aggression.

B08J4FNLXK,6,"",B08J4FNLXK,5.0,"This is a nice little set that builds a really well shaped replica of a classic Masters of the Universe vehicle. But it’s not without some concerns. While it seems strange for a He-Man toy, and for something this small, this is part of Mega’s ProBuilder line. Designed for older kids and adult collectors. It is a tricky build, not for the young’un’s. In part because there is almost no color variation. It’s made of various shaped and sloped small pieces all the same color. You will need good light for the instructions.<br /><br />The vehicle is sturdy and has some play features. It separates into two. With the front being a classic He-Man sky sled. There are parts to make it as a Good Guy sled with horse/dragon head or bad guys snake head on the front. The rear has a missile shooter. There is space for two figures. One on the front sled, the other on a rear step.<br /><br />The 2 figures are new in the Mego MotU lineup. Triklops, with spinning eye thingy. And Mekaneck. Mekaneck’s play feature is awkwardly simulated with two extension pieces that you can add between his head and torso. It looks weird, but no weirder than the original toy. Mekaneck has his cudgel and Triklops a rapier type sword.<br /><br />Overall a nice set and a good compliment to the ProBuilder Castle Greyskull from 1-2 years ago.",,"A nice set, but older kids only",AHSLRVYVCA7H5OKMHGBIWIAZPQDA,true

It has a nice short stand that gives it the illusion of hovering well enough.<br /><br />The Luke figure is well done and on par with the better SW Black figs. He is in his Tatooine garb.

B011FIJUZQ,0,"",B011FIJUZQ,4.0,"A really nice movie Iron Man Armor. The Shotgun armor is one of the ones seen in the finale of IM3. It is sometimes referred to as the Hypervelocity Armor, Hypersonic, or Intercontinental or Balistic Armor. Basically a long range high speed suit designed to get anywhere in the world fast. The downside being it was lightly armed and armored compared to the main combat suits.<br /><br />Comicave does a nice job with this figure. The sculpt is sharp. It is almost pure metal and very weighty. The articulation is decent. Elbows and knees are doubly hinged with moving covers. Hips pull down ala SH Figuarts. Waist and abdomen is ok, not great. Shoulders are a bit limited with no real pull out cross chest jointing. The only real fail is the head. Due to the lighting it can only look up and down. No side to side swivel. And the look up is extremely limited. Not sufficient for flight poses.<br /><br />The figure comes with a nice stand that uses a very robust waist clamp. It's a little too intrusive for my tastes, but holds the heavy figure securely. The stand has parts for either standing or posed flight display. Other accessories are a plethora of hands and three jet exhaust effects parts. One large for the thruster backpack and two small for the hands. They look great, but the hand ones don't peg in real securely. A noteworthy detail on the head is the sliding trans black outer visor that can slip down over the eyes. There are also some moving thruster panels on the rear of the legs.<br /><br />The electronic effects look good, but are finicky. My switch is flaky and takes a lot of fiddling to turn on. Changing the batteries requires splitting the figure at the waist. The figure includes a small screwdriver for inserting the batteries, and a microfiber polishing cloth. I assume that is standard for the line, although a bit pointless with the matte black colors of shotgun.<br /><br />The figure is a standard 1/12 size action figure, so roughly the same size as SH Figuarts, Figma and Marvel Legends for display. Sharp eyed fans will note that Shotgun shares the same mold/body as the Shades stealth armor. Fun comic fact the Hypervelocity suit was originally an outer suit that fit over the Stealth suit. Iron Man used the two to quickly get to and infiltrate the Soviet Union during the Armor Wars in order to reclaim or destroy Stark tech being used in the Crimson Dynamo.<br /><br />Sadly Comicave has just cancelled three announced Iron .Man armors, and would seem to not be doing well.

Most amazing in that it is not simply a recolor of the more common Pink RAcaseal. This is the fairly uncommon &quot;Blue Burst&quot; Variant.<br /><br />First up the Standard Pink Racaseal while sharing the same sculpt to (most of) the figure in this set, is wildly different in what it offers as extras. I would suggest you go examine that set to see the huge bounty of what it comes with.<br /><br />This set has a very different selection of accessories. The box is about twice the size of the standard pink. Largely because while it contains far fewer accessories than it's pink sister, what it has are much much bigger.<br /><br />The figure itself is the same base figure as the pink. It remains as one of the best most perfectly engineered figures Bandai has produces. Smooth, incredibly articulated, lots of metal. It is a joy to hold and handle. The major differences are where the pink version has a largely pale white skin tone to give it that alien robotic feel, this one has more human shin tones in the face and exposed areas. Where the previous had largely pink clothing and markings this has black with blue markings and pale blue white hair. The biggest difference between the two figures is this one has two heads. The first is the same head sculpt as the pink, just recolored, with the same haunting pink eyes, that somehow seem even more alien against the more starkly black figure. The alternate head is however the true delight. It is a blue eyed human face with combed bluish white hair and bangs and some sort of mechanical pony tail. It turns the figure into not simply a recolor, but an entirely different character. This second head is the one I will be displaying. It is gorgeous.<br /><br />As for the rest of the Accessories, it is clear that this character is not the same &quot;Sniper&quot; type as the pink. Blue Bursts equipment consists of a pair of matched high tech blaster pistols, a really nice samurai sword, an entirely different Mag then the pink, this time it is a pink and white cat like creature, and her main gimmick both a folded and unfolded version of her huge blue and green umbrella. The umbrella is what takes up most of the box.<br /><br />She sahres the same stand parts and stickers with the pink, as well as the &quot;speaking&quot; sign and stand. She also has the expected 4 extra pairs of hands.<br /><br />She does not have the pink's nice accessory box (kind of disapointed there, even though none of Blue Bursts accessories would fit), Pink's &quot;Baby Mag&quot; nor the wing parts. She has entirely different weapons from the Pink, so no sniper rifle, ammo, laser sword, red handgun or the little crystals and their stands.<br /><br />This figure is gorgeous. Near perfect in every way. The only complaint is I could wish that they had a way to store the extra's like they do in her sister. if you already have the pink, do not dismiss this figure as simply a recolor. It is so vastly different as to be an entirely new presentation on display or in play. I had described the pink as a great introduction to a daughter to Gokin, this one is similar although the figure has a much more &quot;Goth&quot; feel to it.

B00U29M55W,5,"",B00U29M55W,4.0,"OK first up, lets address the elephant in the room that so many consumers fail to understand. Megabloks is not Lego. They are not quite up to Lego's insane quality and precision of engineering. But they are getting much much better, and this set is a really good offering of a distinct subject that adds a nice big playset/display piece.<br /><br />The pieces are largely Megablok's newer ABS plastic which is a joy comparred to their older styrene. Giving them a much more Lego like feel. MB pieces tend to have stronger clutch than Lego so they take a little more force to put together and take apart, but they will hold together a little more. (That is a design decision not a flaw in either Lego or MB).<br /><br />Pro's, the set is noce and big. It's Dollhouse design makes it a fascinating play space and lets it look great on a shelf. In some ways it reminds me of the old classic Fisher Price Little People sets that we older types grew up with. Details while a bit sparse are sufficient to task with some nice touches.<br /><br />Con's. It isn't Lego, so kids will need a bit more help.

As packed it is the three sub robots (don't ask me their names). The transformation is amazing and a stunning example of Bandai's mind blowing engineering. I could do this one all day. As packaged the robot is in &#34;perfect transformation&#34; mode. Although some extra parts are included to clean up the final look. Those parts form the only real negatives about the bot.<br /><br />Articulation is ok overall. About the best you can reasonably expect from transforming robots of this scale and detail. It does the job but is nothing to write home about. SOC is all about the engineering and transformation. If you want super posing go see SRC. Metal content is high but not too high. Most of it is internal so the robot feels a bit more plasticky then many SOC's. The weight is there but not the coolness to the touch.<br /><br />Accessories are off the charts. Too many to describe. Tons of weapons. A sword that belongs in your kitchen. A nice stand etc.<br /><br />The only negative is the clean up parts to make the perfectly transformed robot look more anime accurate. The beefed up leg and arm panels and the removal of the backpack kibble. The extra parts have a tendency to pop off with movement making the robot more of a display piece than a &#34;play with me&#34; type. Also taking the red robots legs off and putting them back in the box to effect a good looking transformation is kinda bleah!<br /><br />Overall a great SOC. Not the best, but a nice classic one.

The Knight Fighter Dendel that this is simply a retool/repainted of is absolutely fantastic. But this guy is by far the loosest SRC I have. His waist and torso joints are wobbly and barely hold a pose. He otherwise has exactly the same articulation as Dendel, but he doesn't feel as smooth or tight. While I know that they share the same frame and metal parts, Ogre feels lighter. The paint scheme while serviceable doesn't have a lot of pop to it. Granted that's the design of the robot. The accessories are decent, although the strange cobra head weapon is rather unexciting as those things go. (Not a huge fan of bendy wires). He has 2 heads one of which has 2 faces to allow for open and closed visor looks. (When visor is down its a bad guy, when he turns good he keeps it up.) the figure would have benefited from an actual moving visor rather than head swapping. But a minor nitpick.<br /><br />Overall he looks good. I wish I wasn't comparing it so much to its counterpart Dendel but seeing as they are minor reworks of the same design it's hard to avoid.

B00WV06K2O,1,"",B00WV06K2O,5.0,"A great armored female member of the Rider team. Ok I confess I know very little of the Kamen Rider lore. I just love the SH Figuarts and mainly grabbed her because I liked how the female stylings looked. She is a great little interpretation of the design with amazing details. The head with the detailed faceted eyes just draws your gaze. The paint apps throughout are fantastic. Articulation is amazing, although she does suffer a little bit from the common SH FiGuarts Female difficulties in freely standing in anything but a neutral pose. she is an improvement over some of the earlier fem figs, but still not as stable as the menfolk. The biggest con with the figure is the lack of an included stand. She really does need a Tamashii Stage 4 or similar to stage and pose well.<br /><br />I find her white base, faceted trans red eyes, blue and silver trim all work extremely well for creatively lighting the figure for photography. She is a good study subject for experimenting with lighting positions and colors and such. She would also probably work as a very good artists model for trying to draw armored or scifi female figures. She is finding herself getting used in more and more of my projects just for how well she poses and catches the light nicely. I've also noticed there are a few others in the toy community that seem to favor her for photo shoots as well.

B005MTBJOU,0,"",B005MTBJOU,5.0,"A gorgeous little SRC. I was not expecting how well this feminine little bot would pop and stand out on my display shelf. In pictures it looks a bit like a late model Gundam. All the modern angles and spikiness. But in hand it is a stunning piece. Bright white with metallic sapphire blue and yellow highlights. The shape and sculpt is extremely well done capturing a feminine look and feel without resorting to the usual Rocket Boob approach that is all too often used. (I think this is the only specifically female or feminine robot in the SRC line currently. Hopefully they follow up the announced Godannar with a few of that series fembots). Normally I am not a fan of modern overly and pointlessly spiky robots. But this one has a certain degree of grace and a pleasing aesthetic that I can't quite put my finger on. Never having played the game this is from I can't speak to how accurate the design is. But it looks great regardless. The figure scales well with some of the mid to larger sized SRC's and looks perfect standing beside Hades Zeorymar, Might Gain, Brave J Decker, the GGG big boys and similar. Her head stands about a head taller than Getter Robo 1. While the top fin on her flightpack makes her as tall as Genesic GaoGaiGar's flaming hair.<br /><br />As a figure it is a solid mid to upper end Chogokin offering. The articulation is good, but is a bit limited by the robots base design (the spikiness). One cool feature is the extending knees to increase the range of motion. It seems to have a decent amount of metal. Not a huge amount, but certainly not at the bottom of the die cast list. Metal can be found in the standard lower legs, knees, hips and shoulder joints. Accessories include the big assed rifle a Gundam type beam saber with beam effect, The robots flightpack with movable wings, the typical assortment of hands and a piece to depict when the wrist cannons on the left wrist are deployed.<br /><br />Normally I would list a figures cons, but really this one does not appear to honestly have any. Just a few points where fins or wings may clash with articulation. But nothing unexpected or that I would count against the figure. Yeah the head isn't that pose-able. Welcome to modern robot designs.<br /><br />Overall I would highly recommend this to any and all Robot Collectors.  While not topping the list as a must have, it is most certainly a really really nice to have piece.",,Absolutely fantastic Chogokin Fembot,AHSLRVYVCA7H5OKMHGBIWIAZPQDA,true

The sculpt and finish are beyond amazing. The scales are indivdually picked out and seem to glow gold. The mechanical parts are perfect and have a lot of die cast heft. The articulation is fantastic. Especially MKG's twin tails each with over a dozen points of movement. The three necks are similarly flexible, but are more limited just by relative position to each other.

B00ATZ15ZK,1,"",B00ATZ15ZK,4.0,"Let's be honest here. I don't think anybody is buying these two for themselves. They, like the Big Order Room segment they come with are essentially add ins for GaoGaiGar adding depth accessories and background characters. Which is good, because as stand alones the brothers make for rather dull and uninspired SRC's. Not bad. But they don't really feel like most SRC's. The articulation just isn't as good. They feel more like BanDai's Gundam Mobile Suit in Action line with some weight and metal content. Little details, like how stiff and awkward the back connection for the crane arms are on each, feel out of place on SRC's. I get that the characters and accessories are in many ways Homages to classic robots including some of Sunrises finest. I just wish they hadn't also homages the toy lines awkwardness.<br /><br />Accessory wise the two are mostly similarly appointed. Each has a gun and pencil shooter. Each has a alternate face and standard hands (fist, holding/shooting and open) there is a shield with connectors for hand holding or back mounting. Each also has the older awkward &#34;crotch grabber&#34; Tamashii stand attachment piece.<br /><br />The Big Oder Room is just another quarter slice of the pie with 2 stools. It takes some posing to get them to sit on them.<br /><br />Overall I view this as a nice little display accessory set and add on for GaoGaiGar. As a standalone robot set its at best middle of the pack. The robots are nice, but have no real wow factor that so many of the other SRC's have. The set goes for quantity over quality and gives you two Good robots instead of the normal one really great one.",,A good but not great SRC offering,AHSLRVYVCA7H5OKMHGBIWIAZPQDA,true

So Might Gain Does not transform. But he poses like nobodies business. His arms and legs have a wide range of motion including double hinged armed joints and I swear triple hinged knees.  He has a standard assortment of hands. Fists, Open hands, holding hands and a pointing hand. For accessories he comes with replacement head crest pieces, assuming you m ight lose one, and 4 swords. One silver short sword, 2 gold long blades and a huge forced perspective blade (for taking a picture looking down the blade at the robot). All 4 swords have removable and interchangable handles. There is also a double sided handle piece that can attach any 2 swords to make a dual bladed weapon. That pretty much sums him up. There is also an older style Tamashii stand connector that has to be jammed up into his nether regions to work. (not the most elegant of these)<br /><br />Size and coloring wise he blends in perfectly with the 5 Super Sentai / Power Rangers SRC offerings. Overall I would gave him a solid 5 stars. While not as exciting as some others he is an absolutely perfect interpretation of a classic clean design with no flaws whatsoever.<br /><br />Just a reminder.

It produces a whistle that isn't too-too loud, so it isn't awful to hear. We just blow through it quietly and my daughter mimics us.

Pieces connect similar to Lego, in that one side has bumps and the other side has indents. (sorry if that is confusing, I can't think of a better way to phrase it) They pieces fit together so tightly that my kids sometimes have trouble separating them. One or 2 have already cracked in the process. Also, the only fit in the original box if all pieces that are the same are stacked together, and these are very difficult to separate.<br /><br />I'll admit that the activity doesn't hold my kids' interests for long, perhaps because of the difficulty in separating the pieces. Still, I think it helps with forming letters correctly and I do not regret the purchase.",,Great addition to our homeschool literacy shelves,AHX6F4EHMXS4ARGKQ7B5ROEL7HGA,true

B00RCZ5NJY,0,"",B00RCZ5NJY,4.0,"This glow bug lights up, and has two sound options- a white noise style ocean sound or soothing music. Both are pleasant for the baby and for us adults who have to listen to it. The features are activated by buttons that are pretty easy for older babies to figure out, so they can have fun with that. The ocean sounds help calm my daughter before bedtime. I like that it comes on a loop and can be clipped onto anything like a play gym, stroller, or mobile. I like that the wings are a flexible, rubber material with various textures on it, as I’m sure my 3 month old daughter will want to chew on it eventually. I do think the body of the toy is a little hard for a dangling toy. If I hung this in the wrong way, my uncoordinated baby could whack it and send the thing crashing back into her head. The price is pretty good for something that’s basically a noise machine that kids can knock around and play with too!",,Soothing sounds and lights,AG7QXH56MIJQDL3KIWMIUGWZYERA,true
B01AC7SF7K,0,"",B0BSXDB363,4.0,"Overall, this is a really nice toy. It's cute and my kid responded very positively to it. (Sometimes kids get freaked out by talking, moving, and dancing toys.)<br /><br />Cons<br />- What I don't like about this toy that a lot of manufacturers get wrong are the lyrics to the children's songs. In fact, most children's songs were originally war songs or songs for adults and never intended for children. Over time, they have their lyrics changed or sanitized. This little toy has a girl with an American accent singing:<br /><br />Do your ears hang low?<br />Do they wobble to and fro?<br />Can you tie 'em in a knot?<br />Can you tie 'em in a bow?<br />Can you throw 'em o'er your shoulder<br />Like a continental soldier?<br />Do your ears hang low?<br /><br />Now, you might think there's nothing really egregious about throwing a dead (presumably) continental soldier over your shoulder, but perhaps those exact lyrics would be best sold on the Amazon UK website since continental solider = US soldier from our war of independence.

A child can put it inside, but they just may not get it folded and the whole item stuffed in there as well as closed.

The pieces are vary only slightly from each other. It is very easy to put a piece in a spot that is only minisculely  (bad spelling) different than the correct piece.

There are several types of slimes you can make from glitter, to foam beads, to scented (it's strong...if there is an allergy be aware).  The foam beads is a small amount and if you know about foam beads...they end up all over your house!!  So glad it's a small amount.

Do not make these outside if it has the possibility of picking up particles of dirt...same goes for the house.  Clean your table (or area) before making.  Dirt & dust gets trapped in slime easily. AND don't have paper nearby.  Slime gets stuck to paper and ruins it.  The purse holds all of the slime and no extra ingredients are needed.  The purse is plastic and lightweight, but once you're done with the slime it definitely makes a cute bag...it's good quality. Everything it's made of is plastic and good quality plastic!

He's only 18-months so that probably won't be a problem when he gets older. All in all this truck is a lot of fun.,,My son loves his fire truck,AFVRPF5SN3AY6HTR7DI6KXG5P6PQ,true

Imagine our disappointment when camera operated games didn’t work. Everything else did, and was fun to do, but my son was super disappointed that camera didn’t work. So, I wrote to the seller and got a response the same day. They apologized and sent a brand new console (the mat was working fine), but we had the same problem. I wrote to them again and they replied swiftly again, and sent another new console, which they tested first, to make sure everything was working fine.  They even included a great little gift, to apologizing for the inconvenience. I was very impressed with the speed of response, speed of replacement arrival and thoughtfulness of the extra gift. I could have asked for a refund when I discovered camera wasn’t working,  but these things happen with electronics sometimes and the system itself really is great and soooo much fun, I’m so glad I didn’t.

B000058TJ3,32,"",B0C2Q7B81W,5.0,"Well, I've babysat my grandsons since birth (each a couple months past 6 &amp; 2 at the beginning of the summer), and we've got another due around Labor Day, so Grandpa &amp; I knew it was time to find something other than the tiny little baby pool we'd purchased for our older grandson years ago.  When he outgrew it, I ended up taking him to a local park that had a water feature, but that wasn't going to fly this year... his little brother is MUCH more rambunctious than he was, and he's much FASTER than Grandma to be able to chase!  Better to have something in our fenced in backyard (and keep in mind that the size of this pool does have fencing requirements, to prevent unthinkable accidents with curious neighborhood kids wandering in unbeknownst to you) where I can more easily contain his wanderlust!  (Not to mention having to pack up all of their gear, in &amp; out of cars, etc. for park excursions.)<br /><br />After pouring over the countless insightful reviews, we decided to try this 10ft x 6 ft Intex pool.  I'm glad I read the box before deciding on a pump... it specifically states NOT to use an air compressor, and warns against over-inflating.  Having had no experience with this size of a pool and not wanting it to blow up in my face from over-inflating, I decided to go with the Intex &quot;Double Quick III S Hi-Output Hand Pump&quot;, and it worked like a charm for me without too strenuous of an effort (and I'm no spring chicken!)  (By the way, I'd read in one of the reviews that this pool holds 1000 gallons of water... that might well be if you fill it completely to the brim, but there's a &quot;max fill&quot; line maybe an inch or two above the lower part of the top portion - it only holds 264 gallons when filled properly.)  My fear of over-inflating probably led to under-inflating... I definitely do have to put a little more air in every couple of days, but the nozzle fits perfectly into the valve and it's not too much trouble.  We didn't want to kill a 10x6ft section of grass, so we purchased a large, thick tarp, doubled it over and the pool fit perfectly on top of it on the back patio (well, it took up close to 1/3 of the patio, but that was fine - plenty of room still for our patio furniture so I could sit close by.)  The drain hole was pretty much pointless, so our solution for emptying it for cleaning is to use a funnel contraption my husband uses for maintenance of his large indoor acquariums... takes a little while, but worked fine and drained right into the grass at the edge of the porch.  Then Grandpa simply stood it up while I hosed it out, and we were able to plop it right back down, ready to fill back up without any deflating necessary.  (Our back yard is situated among mature trees, so we also purchased an Intex pool cover to keep the majority of the debris out.)<br /><br />But the bottom line has to be... do our grandsons enjoy it and is it holding up?  YES and YES, so far-so good.  When the 6 year old first saw it out of the kitchen window, he exclaimed, &quot;WOW GRANDMA, that is AWESOME!!!&quot;  Both of them are in the lower percentile of height &amp; weight for their ages, so the 6 year old dons water wings while I keep a full vest on the 2 year old, but I feel perfectly comfortable with the older one playing around in the pool by himself (always within sight, of course) on the dozens of occasions each day that the younger one says, &quot;Gramma - wanna get out?&quot;, preferring to alternate pool time with trying to see how many of Grandma's flower gardens he can trample before I can get to him!  The pool definitely requires a bit of effort, but the little fellas are worth it, and - at least from my perspective - it's less effort than having to trek to the park every day.",,Our grandsons are REALLY enjoying their summer in the new pool!,AGP47FFUKLGS6KCYZ4VWY6EZ5VMA,true

THIS LISTING is for the SECOND one released, which is called &quot;Bridge Pack&quot; (the item # is Y3278), and it does NOT fold out... it's a 22 piece track pack (not all of the pieces are shown in the photo accompanying this listing), and the only thing differentiating it from the formerly released Straight &amp; Curved Track is that two of the pieces are SMALL, 1-1/4&quot;H interlocking &quot;bridge&quot; pieces... more like little hills, since nothing would fit under them.  The other 20 pieces in this pack are two each of 2&quot; M/F, 2&quot; M/M, 2&quot; F/F, 3 1/2&quot; M/F, 5&quot; M/F, 6&quot; M/F, and four each of 4&quot; curved track (M/F) and 8&quot; curved track (M/F).  A great feature of the countless Take-n-Play playsets is that they're all designed to connect up to each other without the need for additional track, but in our experience, your youngster will enjoy his/her train play even more if you DO get a track pack or two!  In 2010, Fisher-Price took over the Thomas diecast line from Learning Curve's &quot;Take-Along&quot;, renaming it &quot;Take-n-Play&quot;, and the following year they released several options for track additions - a 22 piece Straight &amp; Curved Track (which contains varying lengths of both straight and curved pieces of track that interlock with each other and the playsets), a 20 piece Straight, Curved &amp; Crossing Track Pack (which, in addition to varying lengths of straight and curved track pieces, also includes a plus sign shaped piece with 4 connection points and a curvish &quot;T shape&quot; piece with 3 connections points), an S Curve Track piece (all one piece, with a couple of gate arms that snap into place at each end and folds up for storage), a Bridge (all one piece, with a couple of supports that raise the middle section @ 2&quot; high - each end has a rotating lever that allows a train to go either to the left or the right for a total of four connection points, and folds up for storage.  Unfortunately, while trains can fit underneath the bridge if they're NOT on a piece of track, the middle section is just a hair too short to allow a train to pass underneath if it's actually on a piece of track), and a Flexi Track (a bendable piece of track with pieces that can be added/removed dependent upon the desired length).<br /><br />A couple of more options were added in 2013 - this Bridge Pack, and a Mini Spiral Track (skip it... three interlocking pieces of curved track with three supports of varying length that you snap on to form a spiral - pretty useless, in our opinion.)  Here's something to note - as of March 2015, Fisher-Price lists this with an $11 MSRP marked down to $7.99.<br /><br />In 2010, we were first time grandparents looking into starting a wooden train collection of trains for our grandson, but they were just too expensive.  (And just so you're aware, Take-n-Play products are not compatible with wooden tracks.)  This diecast line fit our budget, and we were super impressed with the weighty feeling, highly detailed diecasts, and the quality made, detail ladened playsets of the first three years (2010 through 2012.)  Starting questioning Fisher-Price's commitment to maintaining quality during the course of 2013, ending up throwing in the towel at the end of that year (with a continuing quality decline ever since... totally plasticized so-called &quot;diecasts&quot;, flimsy playsets, cheaper packaging, etc.)  BUT - man, we had a great run, and have added two more grandsons since then who'll have their turns playing with the collection before we box it all up for the attic until our great grandkids come over to visit one day!  Our oldest grandson's in 2nd grade now, and even though he's pretty much outgrown his &quot;Thomas phase&quot;, he does still occasionally enjoy hauling out all of the different track pieces to create elaborate designs for his younger brother.  If you can get some of the older train models for your youngster, we highly recommend this line and all of the fun that awaits you!<br /><br />The yearly Take-n-Play &quot;Collector Checklist&quot; included with some (not all) products typically features the most recent products, leaving anyone who would be interested in starting a collection (or even those just interested in finding out about various options from the past) in the lurch as far as what's available in this line.  If you'd like to find out all of the playsets in the line since its inception, I'll list them in the &quot;comments&quot; section below (oldest - and I might add, highest quality! - playsets first).<br /><br />10/25/16 update:  I'm going back and adding this update to each of my Take-n-Play reviews, since it's important information for any parents/grandparents out there with a young Thomas &amp; Friends enthusiast who holds a special place in their heart, and is considering beginning a collection for them.  I just found out the TnP line of diecast trains/vehicles/rolling stock with magnetic connectors is being REPLACED by Fisher-Price in 2017 with a diecast line called &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends Adventures&quot;, which will be TnP models modified with PLASTIC HOOK &amp; LOOP COUPLERS.  Obviously, your youngster will not be able to connect the 2014-2016 TnP models (with their flat, round 1-way magnetic connectors), nor the 2010-2014 TnP models - or Learning Curve's compatible 2002-2010 Take Along models - with their protruding 2-way magnetic connectors - with the new types of couplers as of next year.Submit<br /><br />2/17/17 Update:  Fisher-Price must've received a slew of complaints from Take-n-Play owners, because they've now developed magnetic clip engine connectors (to clip onto the magnetic trains - but ONLY those with the flat round 1-way magnets... they don't want to invite comparisons between the high quality of the older trains with protruding 2-way magnets! - that have a plastic hook &amp; loop coupler to be able to connect to the new Adventures engines), along with track adapter pieces (Take-n-Play track pieces/sets have only 1 male or female part at the end to connect up to other track/sets, while the new Adventures tracks/sets have both one male &amp; 1 female part on EACH end), available by directly contacting F-P.",,"Amazon has 2 DIFFERENT Take-n-Play listings with \"Bridge\" in the title...",AGP47FFUKLGS6KCYZ4VWY6EZ5VMA,true

It is a Christmas gift for my almost 4 year old and my 1 year old. The 4 year old is almost too big for it. If she leans on it or puts any weight on it the plastic looks like it is about to break. With that being said we originally bought this house for outdoor use however the plastic is very flimsy so there is no way it could hold up. It will be staying inside and I hope it lasts us a few years that way. Another note is that this package does arrive in the original packaging which is why they got their gift early. They found it on our door step and it's obvious what it is. Just a heads up so no one else makes that mistake. Overall I think this would be a good playhouse for 18mo to 2 years old and indoor use only.

They ARE bath toys (I don't remember if that's stated anywhere in the product description) although they are perfectly capable of being played with out of the tub too.

Heat Wave was the trickiest to transform (tuck in his arms then rotate the whole upper body backwards -towards the ladder). With all that being said, my 3.5 year old son had it down by the end of the first day, so it's really not that difficult. They seem to be holding up well, there has been a lot of transformations in the past 48 hours. We did have to have a conversation about how they were plastic so we have to be a little gentle with them when transforming.

I also thought the imagery of a seemingly dead rabbit, hunter and tree stump was weird. However when my wife (from Taiwan) first saw the image, it meant something differently to her as the image portrays an old Chinese idiom/proverb, which typically are 4 words/characters that tell a story or gives some life lesson. In this case the idiom is 守株待兔 (directly translated as \"watching a tree stump waiting for rabbits\"). The idiom's meaning is : “To wait idly for opportunities” or “To trust in chance rather than show initiative”. Basically the story's message is one of taking initiative and being proactive to get the things you want and not just wait around on the chance that something will happen for you, or that someone will come along and give you what you need. Generally a good message and is something taught regularly to kids from Chinese speaking cultures. (Google it for more context)<br />The third bedtime story picture is probably a take on the Big Bad Wolf. So while I understand the initial strangeness of seeing the bedtime story pictures, just remember that the product was made in China, so these are just images of a Chinese \"fairytale.\" When you think about it, the fairytales we read as kids in America are all a bit scary on the surface (Hansel and Gretel, Jack and the beanstalk, Goldilocks, Little red Riding Hood, etc.)<br />Overall my baby likes the book and helps little ones understand the importance of our daily routines.",,"Cute book, Misunderstood images",AEC3V7U5VIRXSRDBURW3YRKGGYCQ,true

She never seemed to really like the toys and played mostly with the clackers.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after a few months of very light use, the maracas broke open and spewed their contents all over the carpet. My daughter immediately tried to eat what was inside -- something that looked like rice puffs and little silver BBs. Even though we vacuum extensively, we continued to find the BBs buried in the carpet for several days, and at one point, I found one in her mouth. The way the toy broke also resulted in a very sharp, dangerous wood fragments.

It's true that the dough the set comes with is a little sad looking - the containers are tiny, and I honestly haven't even bothered to open them yet.  We've been using it with play dough, and my toddler loves the tools so much that we've had to do play dough several times a day since I brought them out last week.  The stamps might not be particularly thrilling to an older kid, but for a two year old, the very idea of play dough stamps is fascinating.  He especially loves using toothpicks to clean them out when he is done, and the occasional play dough break to stack them into a tower . . .<br /><br />The rolling pins are pretty fun, even for adults.  It's true that they're pretty tiny, but they're the perfect size for little hands.  The cutter is a big hit as well.  We love that they are made of wood and don't seem terribly fragile, like the tools I remember snapping in half as a kid!

B08NWJ817K,5,"",B08NWJ817K,4.0,"This Bey is pretty cool. We have about 15 or so Surge Beyblades now, and we have been waiting for this one. It looks pretty awesome, and while it’s performance in the stadium is only average, it is still a must get Beyblade.<br /><br />We really like the colors of this Bey. Dark purple, bright pink and grey highlights the design of this. Very nice.<br /><br />The performance tip is only found on this Bey. It allows Beyblades to spin a long time and is unique.  It is one of the best, and you can make some great combos with other pieces too.<br /><br />The forge disk looks neat, and while is doesn’t have any gimmicks, I still like it and think it looks neat. We like mixing and matching with it as well.<br /><br />The performance layer is okay ability wise, but the slopes aren’t all that great. It does burst fairly often (seems like they made most Surge Beyblades do that) but not all the time, and is does burst others too (has burst Glide Roktavor at times which is probably one of the two best Surge Beys). Overall it’s fine but not one we use unless we use the stock combo.<br /><br />If this wasn’t a main Beyblade in the Surge series, I’d still recommend based on the performance tip and the fact that I do like the forge disk even if it doesn’t have any gimmicks. It being the main antagonist’s Beyblade makes it a must get for us too. We like using it, making unique combos with its pieces, and will continue to do so for some time.

B0050542RM,1,"",B0050542RM,5.0,"This is a must have. It adds so much to the game it is great. The fact that it also adds a 6th player is perfect because the game plays flawlessly with 6, just like lower play counts. Now, I will say that paying full price is way too much as it is almost the cost of the game. Paying around 20 dollars seems quite reasonable.<br /><br />What I think is neat is that if you don’t want to do a second place winner, you can use the stuff found in here just to change up the game. To me it really seems like you can add parts as “modules” instead. Want to press your luck panning for gold? Draw a card. Want to go after an outlaw to mitigate dice rolls? Give up your chance for the sheriffs star. Really quite cool. We use it both ways depending on how competitive the group is. Both ways are great.<br /><br />This is great on so many levels that I can’t recommend enough. I will say though, that if you are playing with a second place, it might be hard to remember the options, and more difficult to learn the game for new players, so just be aware.",,Must have expansion,AEGDKPFOVWT4E3LRL4HJ35PRA2YA,true
B085Q15TPF,6,"",B085Q15TPF,5.0,"This was a good price at less than 15 dollars. My son saw an ad for this on a tv show and said he wanted it. When asked a few weeks later for his birthday what he wanted, he still wanted it, so he got it and another for his bday. This one is way better.<br /><br />This one has a cool design with unique parts. While these come with figures, the figures are not really to play with. The ships however are a pretty cool concept and can withstand rigorous play without breaking apart.  They can be used like regular toy ships, and then modified how you like. They have some blasters and such so they are pretty cool. They can even be put on a display stand.  These are like Lego met an old school action toy line of ships. Pretty neat.<br /><br />The pieces stay together well and can be put together in a variety of configurations. The fact that it comes with three designs is also neat as they can inspire you to make your own ship using the foundation of the included designs.  I’d say an 8 year old will easily get the concept of these and have no problem putting them together and taking them apart.<br /><br />I also like the coloring of the KLAW ships the best. It doesn’t look plain. The other styles does. If I was buying more I’d lean towards buying more of the KLAW faction. These are neat and we will see how long it holds the interest of my kids, but for now, they are good buys as they still play with them daily and we like making new designs.",,"Pretty cool, I like this one better than the others",AEGDKPFOVWT4E3LRL4HJ35PRA2YA,true

It is a great frame that is a must have for any collection and is used all the time.  I would almost buy this Bey just for the frame.  The performance tip is very good as well, and allows for Beys to have a lower center of gravity.  This is great in stadiums that are not designed for the new Hypersphere Beys (we use older and the new Hypersphere stadiums) and is used often.<br /><br />A great Bey that I am glad we added to our collection, and I would not hesitate to get again.

B07BHHC4S1,1,"",B07BHHC4S1,5.0,"This game is awesome.  There are so many nuances to the game that it is easily one of my favorites, and it is the game that I want to play the most.<br /><br />Components: This box is jam packed with stuff - it's hard to fit it all!  The game board is beautiful, and is very nice quality.  The workers and goods are all nicely produced wooden pieces, and the cards are quality stock.  The minor things that I find less desirable are that the box could definitely benefit from a better insert for organization purposes (I had to modify mine to contain sleeved cards and all the other components and was even a tight fit without sleeves with the \"insert\").  Additionally, they give you cards to represent multiples of goods which I am not a big fan of.  I just wish I had more goods, and a better insert to handle these pieces as there is room.  Neither of these things affects gameplay, but they are something I wish they had done differently.  Lastly, I wish the player boards were made of thick cardboard, as that would have really made it pop.  With these few things, the look and feel is not as great as it could and should be - although it is still incredible.<br /><br />Gameplay: There are two main ways to try to get larger amounts of victory points, with lots of ways to get smaller amounts of victory points as well so that players can pick different ways to try and win.  There is some player interaction in this game as well which is great because lots of worker placement games are mainly trying to see which spaces are still open, and where your opponents may place their workers - not this game, here you want to pay attention to where other players are putting their workers so that you can capture them to acquire things you want.  The fact that you start with all your workers is also really cool.  There are so many places to put your workers..... Oh yeah, it also has a good solo mode, and you can play 2 players with and auto - very cool and well thought out.<br /><br />Overall: For my minor issues I would normally take a star off because this game looks AMAZING, and then there are some shortcuts taken, which for me I normally find dissapointing.  HOWEVER, the gameplay is sooooo great that I just can't bring myself to do that.  5 stars.",,Favorite worker placement game,AEGDKPFOVWT4E3LRL4HJ35PRA2YA,true
B01ARGATPC,7,"",B01ARGATPC,4.0,"To start with, game play is great.  It is an almost identical cooperative game to Ghost Fightin' Treasure Hunters, but there are more options available in this version to increase difficulty by using certain cards/rules.  This increases interest and enjoyment.  The directions are great, and tell you the differences clearly - another big plus.  This game is great for ages 5 on up because you can talk through strategy and is great for developing those skills.  The figures (with backpacks that you can put the pieces in is awesome), ghost components that are both solid and look neat (not intimidating for kids), and dice are AMAZING.<br /><br />Now towards the bad.  The box is not well made at all.  It is thin and while the insert has good organization, it too is thin and flimsy.  Another problem with storage is that the pieces themselves don't have resealable bags, and since the box is so flimsy it can easily open and become disorganized - especially the small, cheap feeling, inconvenient game cards (why didn't they make them normal size and out of decent quality card stock?).<br /><br />The design of the game board looks OK, but it isn't amazing, and here is where it really turns ugly.  The board is small, flimsy and not well made.  It sounds like the press-board is separating every time you set up the game.  I worry about it falling apart easily with use because the game is fun and will be played a lot.<br /><br />It is because of how fun the game is that I give it 4 stars, but cannot give it 5 due to the board being meh at best, the cards being very inferior, and the organization being so-so, but I am glad that I have it as I know it will get used a lot.",,"The Good (Gameplay and most components), the Bad (Storage) and the Ugly (Cards and Game Board)",AEGDKPFOVWT4E3LRL4HJ35PRA2YA,true

Some minimal assembly required. Took maybe 10-15 mins to get everything together. Only a few stickers which is nice had to be added. ( I don't love doing stickers, not my forte!) Overall assembly isn't too bad. Instructions made it very easy to read and understand. I like these a little more than legos; these do not as many pieces to assemble and that means less pieces to go missing over time. It doesn't really specify which food goes where on the stand so you can just put most of it wherever. I used the box as a reference for some of it and the rest just stuck it some where. Which had to keep moving some of it around because it wouldn't all fit right. The weight is OK for the balance of the toy. The bike isn't very heavy and the cart is so when moving it, it will tip over if not careful. The man can't sit with attachable apron on but he seems as if he is supposed to be standing on the bike. The umbrella is a little wobbly but wasn't to big of a deal. Slimer himself is only an inch big, would have been better if he was larger but he is slightly bigger than the lego figure that came with lego demintions. It comes with several tiny slime sticky's that are reusable and stick to most surface easily, not greasy, not real slime, kinda like plastics clings that you stick on window and remove easily but not the true sticker kind of clings.

B07V4CVFJB,1,"",B0BPDG1R7Q,4.0,"These are excellent! They are more durable than the balsa wood gliders on the market. I find that important since I gave these to my granddaughters ages 5 and 7. They had the best time making them fly. The planes seem to need a little additional weight in the front end. A previous reviewer showed putting some epoxy putty around the back side of the \"cot-pit\" profile which seemed to work. My critique is how they are packaged. The body of the two planes are stuffed into a box too small which caused the vertical tail part to obtain a slight bend which is difficult to straighten without risking snapping the tail off. This makes the planes glide in large arching circles rather than fly straight. They planes being made of molded foam are quite durable and resist damage from crashing or getting hung up in nearby trees. It also should permit the little ones to get more than one use out of them! lol<br />The planes are clearly not indestructible but I feel are a good value overall and do recommend these.",,Excellent gliders!

So when you add the current Aerialbot limbs, which tend to be slightly shorter shins but long arms, Ultra Prime really looks like a gorilla. Not elegant or commanding of an iconic figure such as Optimus Prime. Motormaster would look excellent in this mold, and the torso mode seems appropriate for Menasor.

Typically, shaft sizes are a tiny bit smaller than bore sizes in order to fit a shaft of say, 3mm into a 3mm bore hole.

B09DVVFX9K,6,"",B09DVVFX9K,5.0,"The setup is simple. Refer to the applicable setup for your TV type on the instructions.  If you have smart tv, screw coax from antenna to the provided amplifier box.  From the amp box screw coax to tv antenna port & insert usb to a USB port on tv.  Follow the instructions on scanning for channels - I referred to Google a few times. The only difficulty I incurred was finding the exact correct location for the antenna. The total length of coax is ~ 12’.  Don’t rule out any location. If you’re alone, turn up the volume if you can’t see the screen, then you’ll know when the particular channel(s) comes in based on the channel setting - same channel numbers you had before (ie 8 for ABC).  YOU HAVE TO FIND THE PERFECT LOCATION for the antenna placement. Roll up a small piece of duct tape or whatever you have so it’s two-side and place on the large red spot on back of antenna. I first tried the window, scanned and got no air channels.  Placed it on wall behind tv near ceiling, got 4 air channels.  Lowered it 2 feet from ceiling and ~ 3’ above tv on same wall and pow, hit the sweet spot.  Got 24 channels - the ones I needed.  Use TV remote, go to source and scan channels - this will vary depending on your exact tv, but it’s intuitive (or Google it).  You can choose air channels and or cable channels.  While scanning the tv will display the number and types of channels found & downloaded. Once scanning is at 100%, close screen and you should see menu with the channels available for viewing, if channels were downloaded. You may have to scan multiple times to find what you want.  Keep scanning and keep moving the antenna!  And the picture quality is outstanding.  I think it’s true 4K. I have Samsung QLED 4K, but not all channels are broadcasted in 4K.

B092J829Y5,0,"",B096MCYNFX,1.0,"Update: I've had this a few weeks now and have tried using it.  I have a 2000 piece puzzle with small pieces, it's about 30% together at this point, and they all just break apart when I try and roll it up, I've tried several times with different levels of tightness when rolling, the puzzle falls apart no matter how I do it. This coupled with the info listed below in my original review makes it pretty much worthless.<br /><br />_____<br /><br />First, this comes folded so if you want it to lay flat after unfolding it, you will need to iron it.  I don't see this anywhere in the description and I don't have an iron so that makes it hard to use.  I'm hoping with time that the folds/wrinkles will relax.<br /><br />I generally do puzzles by putting pieces togheter and sliding them around to fit as the puzzle comes together, you can't really slide pieces on the felt, they come apart.  I guess this is both good and bad - the pieces kind of stick so if you have them where you want them, that's good, but if you need to move chunks of pieces that are already together it's not so great.<br /><br />I've yet to try and roll my puzzle up and move it, so I can update my review later after that happens and I see if the folds in the felt relax to make it lay flat.",,"Doesn't work, puzzle breaks apart when roling it up",AHAKXUAMISZX2IMGF4WTDIFV5MSA,true

To be fair, it was under ten dollars, so I don't know that I should have expected more - but Pressman used to be a good brand. Not sure what they're doing putting their name on this sort of product.<br /><br />The boards are made of poster board, not the thick material you'd expect from a board game, and they're not folded; the size of the box is the size of the playing board, so they're just too small.

Once you know how long you can fly on a certain LiPo battery without depleting it to where it's damaged, you'll be able to better maintain all of your LiPo batteries.

She has pulled them off and redesigned the faces enough that they no longer stick very well but the actual pumpkins are still in great shape and we will repurpose them for other crafts.<br /><br />My one gripe is that the stickers are on four or five big sheets together. It would be better to have the stickers for each face on one sheet so you can give them out one at a time and let the kids peel the stickers off themselves to design the faces (one face per sheet of paper).

However, the &#34;saws&#34; that stick out the front are just plain silly, and the spinning action doesn't seem to make the toy more fun. It would have been just as much fun to have a toy that didn't spin. Imaginext has a plane where you pull the triggers and make the propellers spin--that makes sense. But to have the whole cockpit spin around and around? Not really.<br /><br />Still, my daughter flies it around the house occasionally (although she doesn't use the spinning feature much) so it does get played with from time to time.<br /><br />Oh, my six year old wanted me to tell you that &#34;the fact that it spins around is bogus.&#34; :)",,"Ok, but certainly not great.",AEEFYNFPBBZHNRUAHXLU2BU7W4QQ,true
B07YQ641NQ,19,"",B08M4WM6YR,3.0,"I bought this based on the reviews and that it was on sale (yet still expensive.) We do board game nights with friends and also my wife and I like to play together occasionally. We have given this game six plays so far, and ultimately it's a disappointment.<br /><br />Pros: 1) I love the bird cards. They are informative and interesting. 2) It seems at first like it will be an interesting strategy game. This feeling however is short-lived.<br /><br />Cons: The game was not complicated for us. We came to understand the rules and the engine-building strategies quickly. However, aside from that the game is very slow, it's just ultimately not that interesting. We tried different engine-building and points-accumulating strategies to see if anything would make the game more interesting, but continued to be dismayed. There are two primary disappointments we keep encountering: 1) Nothing very interesting is happening in the game, then you see how to build some kind of potentially kind of interesting end-game combinations, but oh, wait, you can't because the game always ends very quickly. (Each round played (4 rounds), the players have less and less turns/moves.) 2) You build strong engines that still ultimately are boring. I can get 6 cards a turn? Neat. So what? They're just not that interesting, even with the small variety of ways they can be used. I can get 4-5 cards per turn or 3 food and 2 eggs? Wow, that's pretty powerful, but still kind of boring, especially because the game is probably at least halfway over. Maybe you'll have enough moves/turns in the round to put 2-3 somewhat stronger birds in play, maybe even a couple of weaker birds with them. But again, so what? It's not going to have a big impact on events in the game.<br /><br />It's just way too slow, and ends frequently when possibilities are starting to look kind of \"neat\" &lt;-- though never all that interesting. Just kind of \"neat.\" And there never has been a strong feeling of wondering who is going to win or lose, that anticipation. Even if cards are hidden, there aren't that many points-surprises. Sorry but again it's just boring.<br /><br />Although I realize they are different games, Wingspan reminds me of Ticket to Ride (a game we still really enjoy), but Wingspan is more complex (while complexity can often make games more interesting, here it fails) and much, much slower.<br /><br />And it has many more different kinds of pieces. Woe to those who lose any of the many pieces to this game.<br /><br />EDIT: We created a house rule to sort of work together and see who can get 80+ points, and that made the game a little better. In the competitive rules, you fight each other for round points, hide cards from each other, and can even block each other by snagging good cards and not activating your own cards that can help others. In the house version, we play the non-competitive round points board, show our cards, and don't block other players. So the game becomes about trying to help each other put together neat little combos and strategize to get to that 80. And means multiple people can win. This makes it a player-vs-game entity. This also opens up some more conversation, though not all that much more. Unfortunately, if people are talking and helping each other, it means they're not planning their own moves, which means the game takes longer.<br /><br />Speaking of which, that 40-70 minute play time? Hahahaha, no, not going to happen.",,Ultimately Disappointing,AECNRFQFFOGMNJGCH4YEJFGJ5ZYQ,true

It's a pass and play game where you try to build a better sushi dinner than your friends. Cards are thick and good quality. Art is cute, and good re-play value because of all the combinations you can make/goal setting, etc. Would recommend for any game night, kids through adults.",,Great for Kids and Adults.

With game nights all over the place, it was worth it for me to get the deluxe edition. Great game in the vein of Yahtzee but with cards and a little more cut throat competition.

B014NP4TAO,0,"",B0C27VX2JL,1.0,"I was so excited about this kite. Followed assembly directions, and went to fly it, but the main support snapped in the first 30 seconds of flight, unable to be repaired. I think it could’ve been prevented if I had used heavy amounts of duct tape to reinforce the kite spars after assembly and before flying, but the instructions do not call for this. Just common sense. I ended up with some glass splinters in my finger too from the snapped support as I tried to repair it.<br /><br />I’d recommend spending a little more and upgrading to a better made kite so your weekend plans aren’t ruined like mine were.",,Broke on the first flight,AHP67Q7FZQJPPIPY5MTTGRKI3FLQ,true
